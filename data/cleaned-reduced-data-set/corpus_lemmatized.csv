kinda odd thing looked snap ons database shopkeypro found bleeding order front left rear left front right rear right kinda odd like normal double checking went nissan forum found different order curious anyone else dealt
work work furthest caliper master cylinder brake work fine correct order presumably found leave otherwise rebleed rear right rear left front right front left
drive nissan xterra recently changed oil sadly check volume oil removed car adding new oil half quart low removed quart bc bad angle hill added quart driving overheating oil clearly leaking somewhere vehicle run normal thing different driver side front end started squeaking badly presume bc oil driver side front obviously drain oil check leak see something badly damaged check oil aerated would oil leaked dipstick running want check catastrophic damage
found post month ago seems many people use rcars kind inquiry ever figure issue
title state whenever turn key dash light dim flicker car chug time going completely dead time doesnt anything get machine gun sound happened get car start use portable battery pack jumpstart usually turn right without problem turning car itll start right within hour leaving sit longer jump bought battery back june battery year warranty went get tested autozone employee said battery completely fine car running right checked didnt show problem sign stated wouldnt continue warranty battery perfectly fine please let know battery bad something else tldr need jump start battery everytime start car part store employee state battery completely fine
also jumpstarting car letting engine run usually enough charge dead battery would remain connected charger least couple hour attempting start engine often use car every day happening would agree parasitic drain battery car get used couple time week short trip example battery discharge time best solution latter case battery maintainer keep battery full parked access electrical outlet sure check interior light make sure shutting walking away car probably common cause sudden dead battery another thing keep mind longer battery stay dead chance going bad increase meaning wont hold charge like lead plate inside battery become sulphated
likely battery issue slow drain could parasitic draw id use yr warranty battery first
hey yall dont normally post reddit got car last august used pretty much great condition part month half ago started noticing ticking sound vibration car violent anyone sitting car voice would shake vibrating college student part time job want take shop scared price would couple friend take look equally decided motor mount decided replace three motor mount vibration stopped ticking still happens press gas tend hear outside car reason physically car hear ticking noise also morning havent driven car whole bunch day car expert also dont lot money hoping someone could maybe know experience noise could could fix thanks
checked oil make sure full changed oil since bought need keep checking oil often make sure full line dipstick add oil distance low full one quart oil half way low half quart oil low change oil due every mile month oil change check make sure level good one nothing good start
possible engine valve train worn isnt lubricated would make tick car cold like morning used throughout day might need new one thats probably something take shop really could number thing would take somewhere least get idea shop take look sometimes less youll know easy cheaper fix something urgent save needed
happened coolant hose impreza started leaking onto serpentine belt serpentine belt basically throwing coolant everywhere spun recently started noticing steering wheel getting stiff slow park etc speed move normally could coolant caused problem looking different issue
antifreeze cause belt slipping low power steering fluid internal damage steering boxrack cause stiff steering
coolant oil serpentine belt cause slip speed dont really need power steering anymore wouldnt notice gone get coolant leak fixed run dry overheats engine need head gasket
belt likely sipping getting covered coolant

hear story story camrys going really mids camry already quite thousand redoing suspension cv joint battalt usual stuffnow need new catalytic converter pipe probably soon rack pinion going need servicing burning oil know need new windshield mean engine tranny fine except burning oil part normal wear tear yearsno demolition derby regular plain old driving cost fix going cost half newer used car anyway cant justify investment mi folk keep pouring endless thousand year old car
listed worth stuff say newer used car show car isnt liable exact issue keeping car running isnt free yes people decide put couple grand take loan next year
good maintenance schedule product go long way
someone say car lasted mile mean engine hasnt exploded shit gonna break within timeframe nothing super important break warrant engine replacement still engine thing really kill engine block damage like slipped bearing piston getting smashed around piston ring replaceable typically dont take block fail
answer mostly dumping money wear part luck people getting camry arent afraid replacing ball joint bushing also arent worried thing burning oil there car road world reliably get even moving suspension component unless youre work thats going add way price
one get without spending money car maintenancerepairs cant nothing neglect simple thing never spend money expect car last thats thing
either pour thousand loan die fix car thats need something else youve maintaining generally repair wont crazy gas oil cheap insurance windshield happen brand new car mile literally luck starting beater yeah overwhelming
weather car used also big factor longevity
allotting year last year done hardly anything maint prior thing wont need done another year thats equivilent payment less new vehicle take pick
cost fix going cost half newer used car anyway cant justify investment repair ish
folk early corolla odometer stopped working many year ago still flawless work need future far shock replacement front left car driven regularly never problem
thats bad also people dont realize actual major maintenance item need done overtime done last another year bushing suspension etc always going cheaper pay car go another year new car need exact maintenance item get point expensive prelude first actual nonmaintenance issue requires engine rebuild even less payment new car brand new engine

juice isnt worth squeeze youll spending lot money gaining much
racing pinstripe side add hp
engine there basically zero extra horse power non turbocharged engine thing like fitting cold air intake pod filter high flow exhaust proper tune maybe get increase cost value car properly cost fit aftermarket turbocharger properly engine converting even another polo engine would expensive buying polo bigger powerful engine
lot people said cheapest way get faster car current position buy faster car aside amount cost modify youd also declare modification insurance making shit ton expensive advice would use bhp polo learning tool car work journey went bhp golf quite old cost played car mechanic simulator bought haynes manual watched youtube vids learned change brake spark plug oil etc service check mot dont get ripped even changed timing belt radiator eventually learned weld sill im slowly rebuilding engine mx also picked albeit broken engine bhp working might start pouring money modding well see relax enjoy shitbox banger life absolutely love golf know point built half learned lot saved lot money there lot enjoyment simply focusing overtake
ideally buying slow car remapping naturally aspirated engine going much swapping engine great fun project cost end close selling turd buying polo gti

actually protect work best manufacturer switched thinner oil improve fuel economy fact car sold different market north american car require others require bring downvotes
youre going get straight answer different school thought people say always use manufacturer recommended viscosity engine others say okay increase viscosity engine get older dad one increase viscosity car got older always stuck see getting older burning quart oil every oil change see logic wanting put something thicker think youll okay especially toyota engine completely understand opposing point well flip coin
fine daughter cx recommends exact engine europe recommend thinner oil emission arguably worse engine run
better engine recommended get rounding error better fuel economy trade saving like cent week fuel engine wear
run change check service manual youll learn change oil weight based ambient temp operate vehicle weight mostly emission purpose engine rd world country spec call thicker oil oil change interval shorter conventional oil nz engine originally specd google yaris forum discussion toyota switched thinner synthetic increase oil change interval
im one outsmart guy engineered short termlike monthis fine long term id change spec engine tolerancestypically bearing designed weight mind old saw thicker better wrong today tight tolerance esp starving student last thing need major engine trouble
depends climate region driving finnland need thinner oil greece thicker oil thats
fine never make difference
exact engine market actually recommended naeurope want thin stuff mpg reason
mate favor better oil
fine close put id say change right away
never use anything manufacture recommends circumstance car old use high mileage oil never change kind oil

lot reason compressor could seized idler seized belt worn etc speculation wouldnt try turn someone look case something worse everything fine isnt
yeah didnt put belt back correctly damaged changing compressor half decent shop would replaced belt compressor anyway
usually kind post ops wrong work causing subsequent failure time may well shop fault removed compressor removed belt also belt bad shape wouldnt think twice replacing new one adding part cost compressor replacement decent shop would fix good faith itll take minute question exactly ac service replace compressorcompressor clutch removed reinstalled belt failed claiming belt good admitting messed reinstalling either damaged repair routed wrong tensioner tensioned
belt came repaired old belt never replaced age caught surprised shop didnt add belt replacement along pulley tensioner give option
belt came repaired old belt never replaced age caught surprised shop didnt add belt replacement along pulley tensioner give option
definitely snap may run get someone check pulley make sure theyre theretight
belt seldom break something caused typically pulley seizure whether related repair cannot predicted internet
id betting seized idler pulley tensioner could seized alternator power steering pump well could even compressor chance low however new compressor thats seized shop installed warranty
stated currently shop say wrong need know snapped looking picture dont see glazing would indicate pulley seized tow hr cheap want tow far find unrelated due workmanship may want pay fixed instead tow bill bring back shop
put brand new ac compressor jeep couple year back compressor sticker stating compressor prefilled oil day later compressor seized ill bet didnt check pag oil compressor installing
would really bad idea replace belt old one taken
ac compressor belt separate
dollar everytime customer pull shit id rich
guess probably put tight another option would one pulley seized could put enough stress break maybe put wrong alignment would turn pulley hand see move put new belt super easy affordable depending car im highly suspect shop put old one didnt really pay attention wear tear look belt look smooth worn cracking spot

absolutely skip dealer go good independent nothing complex suspension likely needing alignment
could check fcpeuro price would recommend getting oem strut hate people put generic strut ride height wonky would go shop specializes suspension seems early needing strut maybe rough life would replace ball joint bushing refresh everything
rather common job shop issue
take independent get cheaper job better quality work dealer gone as work quality due paying staff imo find private mechanic go beyond find right one
tire center best place daily alignment together usually best price tv lounge
seems awfully early replace shock strut blasting gravel road bog deal shop replace going hear lot shop want replace quick strut preassembled aftermarket full kit generally lower quality original car new would replace strut factory part replace shock part unless something broken cost quick strut keep ride quality put situation replacing blown quick strut regularly
mine ford mustang little tough access common work mechanic
shop strut shock best bet go shop also alignment recommend oem strut front
sway bar link cheap done time upper mount spring strut assembly considered may tired engine mount dog bone many mile sway bar bushing inspected new spring restore ride height camber deviation
kia forte aftermarket led headlight unfortunately led insanely bright awesome think frustrating everyone else lol solution ive heard lot getting readjusted wondering effective maybe trying tint would something like tint could find whether thatd good idea well expect pay went route id probably tint headlight taillight turn signal daytime running light anyone ballpark guess much thatd id appreciate

hey concerning question drive honda crv tank used year old gas get back slightly half tank read online later using old gas damage car topped half new gas local station wanted know im going problem shouldnt even worry
going problem would probably already experiencing pretty diluted fresh gas
good go mine sat year could get fixed ran fine gss setting gas made filter fine
tank old gas time great way use
check engine light went nd time went pepboys get scanned closest place would said crank position sensor need replaced looked video replace look pretty easy
remember code something doesnt always mean thats problem guide start looking dont give u exact year make model engine size along code dig little would suck replace sensor fix bad plug broken wire spun balancer ect
car known bad crank sensor car almost never happens youd want take thorough look replacing sensor dont trust part store employee know theyre come diagnostics dont know much
nothing ever easy look
mechanical generally handy come fixing something answer yes go answer call someone maybe car giant lego lol right set tool simple video get done break something else process figure fix
kind car go slowly fine get good qualitybrand sensor
make mention car make model engine could easy reach might might jack car put jackstands reach sensor rusted place youll break trying remove issue carefully drill handy think handle crank sensor go bad engine start run many car wont even set code make doubt diagnosis especially pepboys counter person counter person mechanic salesperson selling part might need might fight replacement still problem
crank position sensor tend pretty basic unlikely fail would suspect harness connector issue replacing sensor may make problem appear go away may act unplugging sensor scraped corrosion pin fixed issue inspect harness connector spending money course always exception make model may notorious failing cps ymmv
white crusty stuff electrode spark plug indicate head gasket issue believe true wrong
doesnt necessarily mean head gasket issue signifies getting certain amount ho cylinder could fuel head gasket
done nothing besides field repair maybe short stint thing digress younger would joke around unhealthy everything touch maybe dark humor hazardous material touch everyday im getting older look heath active im worried aspect chemical trade related illness come directly linked work everyday info appreciated
honesty exposed fluid chemical many year damage done would much healthier stay away choice way worse old day brake asbestos etc
osha made lot better lot tech lazy ppe lot depends personal habit

hey want know best way wire wire single wire source voltage power car accessory dashcam rearview mirror cam usb charging adapter etc people installed got wire wrapped around terminal car fuse fusebox dash seems quite janky dangerous considering fuse look like pop want install fuse tap relatively safe researched would good method connect wire like soldering crimp heat shrink solder terminal block wago connector etc understand soldering last resort due great mechanical connection especially vehicle due vibration wago connector great quick disconnect high resistance compared crimp wear time crimp great meant wire connection wire one side mismatch awg size result poor mechanical connection inclined crimp considering cant find crimp connector best job scenario multiple wire required might solder since soldering experience decently fuse tap us awg wire auxiliary wire awg car genesis gv thanks advance input

whatever reliable baseline variable would buy land rover
depends much money afford spend maintenance repair give better choice land rover id premium car prefer quality afford buy used premium suv cash like new one pay upkeep per year wouldnt cause financial stress
keep car long time option mean shit break

cooler car less feature less cool car feature
wouldnt buy range new year old range money pit would rather top range accord v bottom level series
would drive ford anything land rover anything
depends engine base trim bunch different engine want big one
driven german luxury sedan year made big change bought base model minivan wanted simplicity reliability happy give many thing dont like leather sunroof adjust seat lowprofile wheel tire make look good higher sidewall mean comfort theyre less expensive fancy body trim mean fewer place moisture get stuck cause rust manual transmission simple low maintenance im longer trying impress anyone car feature want highertrim model usual add im extremely happy gone basemodel route

mean realistically lower maybe bottom trim cheaper car two option top trim cheaper car expensive car expensive maintenance
lot people love flex
owned entry level range rover fully loaded kia id take kia day kia better technology feature also easier maintain much reliable id never buy luxury brand unless money wasnt factor could go edit would like add quality material kia complete junk compared range rover could see someone would prefer base model expensive vehicle something bother much

daily base model cheaper car id rather spend dough thing keeping jones
good question recently would opted buy upgraded nonluxury brand car market shifted fully upgrading normal car cost almost much lower end luxury equivalent thing never available budget brand car matter many toy option big one comfort nvh noise vibration harshness cruising highway lower end vehicle even fully optioned noticeably louder higher drone road noise even base line luxury vehicle luxury live vehicle often equipped laminated glass side window greater sound deadening material quieting road noise higher end tire quieter road surface spend new honda similar sized midrange lincoln acura look closely lot feature honda wont offer cabin comfort ease access concierge service pick updrop service appointment pretty standard luxury brand top everything else luxury brand usually lower volume sale attractive lease financing option often lower interest rate nonluxury brand end day good deal lot price paid happy bought reason price likely keep car longer

current situation exactly got civic type cayenne base enjoy
top trim cheaper car one dream gr yaris
top line civic v base model accord civic type winner vw golf v audi golf winner toyota camry xse v lexus e lexus bmw v bmw series nissan altima sr whatever v infiniti bicycle
top trim sure extra make difference imo
beyond many people buy car various reason
would rather drink molten lead either
depends goal wanting reliability good servicability japanese cylinder vehicle day day land rover haha yeah
daily base trim cheaper car would interested select higher end car know still easily fix
vacuum bottom trim expensive car sound deadening ride comfort two highest selection criterion dont get higher trim cheaper car however would never get used land rover
top trim level lower wouldnt buy land rover
top trim unless exotic
definitely base trim expensive one choosing top trim corolla audi exactly choice made year ago dont regret even drop even tho reliability isnt great id still choose range rover scenario ford also reliable possibly one boring car ever
top trim cheaper car wouldnt want land rover would drive bonkers driving porsche macan v gts id take flex limited tt make sure get extended warranty internal waterpump fails mile cheap job

wouldnt touch either ill rephrase id prefer base camry loaded corolla
ill take want top trim car base option would love civic leather option stick manual seat
id rather ford flex interesting range rover isnt range rover range rover
anything land rover
sorry op almost everybody answered question completely bypassed asking talk shitty land rover answer question though personally would spend money getting higher car fully loaded lower model car
bought top trim civic hatch acura integra regret dont buy land rover
everyone saying wouldnt buy land rover deliberately missing point yes would prefer low trim luxury car high trim budget car high trim mean leather seat glass roof self driving plastic cheapness still remains outside likely powerful engine low trim luxury car mean youre getting leather glass roof minimalless plastic default seat headliner door sill center console get vastly color option beyond blackgray interior higher quality finish build tldr interior supra never interior cclass coupe powerful sure
want stock air conditioning would nice cloth bench seat absolute must
base trim expensive car exception land roveravoid terrible reliability

buy plugin device disable startstop feature plug diagnostic port far shaking stalling problem without trouble code go itll guess faulty part could go autozone part chain get free scan help load firing part cannon ill guess anyway reduced power message usually associated throttle body problem service stabilitrak indicative problem one wheel speed sensor educated guess need info trouble code testing
cruze mine similar problem like shaking reduced engine power turbo boost sensor maf bad throttle body followed suit throttle actually went car went limp mode finally threw appropriate code mechanic fix problem noticed comment also said good news relatively cheap fix comparison thing could go wrong issue mentioned also happen really common year cruzes unfortunately service stabilitrak mostly likely ignore unless still happening fix flash anytime driving right even youre snow losing traction even though totally startling annoying
title implies bought chevy cruze used car dealership almost mile feeling transmission fluid never maintained becuase slipping surging happening im taking shop tomorrow check engine light replaced maf sensor spark plug coil pack valve cover gasket question would better get transmission change flush im think change safer

brake cleaner isnt going fix problem lol
ill use nonflammable brake cleaner
want start fire spray petroleum product firehot piece metal
youll fine
use pb blaster
might want switch semi metallic pad seeing temp related noise ceramic dont deal heat well highly doubt issue related something fix brake cleaner spraying hot rotor volatile chemical isnt going go want go gonna quench steel go badly brake cleaner flash vapor instantly
sound like caliper sticking cause pad rotor overheat glaze need take caliper make sure smoothly move guide pin ive seen lot shade tree mechanic neglect pin dont understand caliper able slide another thing check see pad supposed retraction spring make sure since brake dont believe lot people think optional pad rotor lightly glazed take sandpaper remove shiny portion reuse theyre really bad youll need get rotor turned replace pad
try figure causing squeal spraying likely extremely temporary nothing fix issue lube slider pin section part slide check pad glaze
im debating use air powered spray air duster nonflammable brake cleaner
sound like need brake service squealing usually caused metal metal contact brake component service using lube designed brake might take care unless take everything apart service leave alone get home
nothing getting pad rotor driving spraying anything hot rotor end well could cause warp get hot spot either way probably get vibration braking brake squeal something vibrating usually caliper slide pin pad fitment caliper bracket however case ceramic pad probably using designed brake designed specific driving condition take big truck heard brake squeal coming stop happens unloaded loaded brake operating optimum range empty lighter pressure applied allows rotor slip past pad higher rate causing vibrate unless driving like race track likely using pad optimum range recommend go normal pad resurface rotor
try see happens
decided lube caliper pin ag silglyde spraying anything update guy
find parking lot drive reverse mph slam break hard see squeal gone

ciao tutti vi pongo una domanda che ho testa da un po credo che purtroppo non ci sia una risposta chiara davvero pi sostenibile sostituire unauto combustione funzionante con una nuova elettrica oppure sarebbe meglio mantenerla pi lungo per ridurre la produzione complessiva di veicoli mi spiego meglio da un lato lauto elettrica zero emissioni dirette sembrerebbe la scelta pi ecologicadallaltro la produzione di un nuovo veicolo elettrico comporta emissioni importanti soprattutto per batterie materie prime rottamare unauto ancora funzionante non proprio il massimo ottica di economia circolare inoltre quanto pesa davvero il ciclo produttivo di unauto elettrica estrazione produzione smaltimento tenere unauto termica pi lungo pu avere senso ecologico se si guida poco zone senza alternative quanto conta lefficienza dellintero sistema ricarica da rinnovabili uso condiviso urbanistica qual il vostro punto di vista grazie
ciao domanda super interessante generale sostituire unauto combustione funzionante con unelettrica nuova non sempre la scelta pi sostenibile soprattutto se lauto attuale buone condizioni viene usata poco la produzione di unauto elettrica soprattutto della batteria comporta unimpronta ambientale iniziale significativa legata allestrazione di litio cobalto ecc ai processi industriali tuttavia nel lungo periodo dopo circa km secondo diversi studi unauto elettrica pu compensare quelle emissioni grazie alle minori emissioni fase duso soprattutto se ricaricata con energia rinnovabile quindi il contesto conta tantissimo se si vive una zona con elettricit da fonti rinnovabili molte colonnine si percorrono parecchi km lanno lelettrico ha senso anche ambientalmente se invece si guida poco magari un contesto dove non ci sono grandi alternative di mobilit continuare usare lauto esistente pu essere pi sostenibile che rottamarla presto per un nuovo veicolo ottica di vera sostenibilit il top sarebbe ridurre luso dellauto generale puntare su mobilit dolce mezzi pubblici condivisione dei veicoli ovviamente dipende anche da quanto il contesto urbano infrastrutturale lo permette insomma pi che una risposta secca una questione di equilibri priorit ottimo che se ne parli che si facciano dei distinguo invece di schierarsi tra il demonizzare le auto elettriche magnificarle

listed worth stuff say newer used car show car isnt liable exact issue keeping car running isnt free yes people decide put couple grand take loan next year
good maintenance schedule product go long way
someone say car lasted mile mean engine hasnt exploded shit gonna break within timeframe nothing super important break warrant engine replacement still engine thing really kill engine block damage like slipped bearing piston getting smashed around piston ring replaceable typically dont take block fail

nissan sentra ditch never buy one anything nissan made awful track record transmission especially altimas maximas sentras fact lasted honestly astounding rebuilt one die couple month get literally anything else besides nissan made millenia im saying nissan hater come year experience
probably going hard sell messed transmission history accident still relatively new realistically best thought would sell buy something maybe older nissan transmission consistently bad would personally look like used mazda hondaacura toyotalexus whatever cash get
wouldnt put transmission modern nissan cvts used nissan last year complete garbage get another car sure
called around local transmission shop see much cost rebuild dont nissan ever issue tranny died car worthless got local shop long time business good review got rebuilt year unlimited km warranty maybe option call around see never one
cvt yeah unfortunate however tranny fix year year car payment youd nailed car couple year get yr andor mile guarantee new transmission id try wreck often
cvt feel like nissan cvt transmission bit bad rep might want factor calculation deciding whether cost transmission guarantee enough additional use vehicle needing additional repair youve sunk bunch money pretty confident state repair rest car getting reconditioned transmission might refresh back pretty good starting point lifespan cvts look anywhere kk mile dependent little bit driving style well keep serviced little bit sheer luck lol thats something keep mind sentra isnt inherently bad car hold onto keep alive
normally id say ditch sentra considering disastrous used car market moment might better move fix biggest argument fixing transmission worst ever put car itd really suck spend something thats probably gonna die
another user mentioned rebuilding transmission typically one rebuilds labor intensive meaing high labor cost probably hard technician rebuild cvt arent many salvageable cvts rebuild many cvt part arent available youre stuck buying transmission get new part im biased love manual transmission would get rid car get different good japanese car legit speed automatic manual trans like shifting gear car cvt nissan sedan crossover honda sedan crossover subaru sedan crossover toyota corolla toyota always little slower company design camry started using cvt company cvt better nissan hard find japanese car legit automatic transmission mazda actually special absolutely refuse use cvt model mazda great choice love automatic japanese car

since youre asking yes especially youre saying torqued good mean didnt torque ugga duggad whatever impact floating around
called staking done there locking feature lock washer nylock warlock
yes must indent driving vibration loosen call customer back dont lose sleep
manufacturer cv shaft milled flat axle mill needed wear extra money needed spend
indent antiloosening normal use would subjective
definitely need staked
well prefer wheel falling ya need
replace nut every time anyway im sure unsure hit punch
constantly rotating vibrating piece chance loosens time worth gamble
yes youre supposed invent way put cotter pin ball joint extra measure safety
course nut come cause damage money mine absolutely thats part design ensure nut doesnt come think way engineer tasked making something fit list spec costing little possible take extra action assembly line indent nut time money assembly line engineer didnt find necessary action wouldnt included design nope dont put clothes leaving house either may like result may like result dont indent nut either
torqued good mean probably tight snap next poor barstard go try remove
yesunless want loosen driving
yes spindle nut unthread front dana freeway tacoma almost rolled got wheel always stake nut require second nut keep thing tight use thread lock
go buy torque wrench properly dent easy
depends cv axle car manufacturer like ford focus thing german good tight milwaukee put red loctite thread new nut think hondas toyota manufacturer recommend require indent
reason wheel bearing require torqued certain spec stay cv nut back itll cause beating failure prematurely
yes indent indent isnt meant stop socket getting loose prevent vibration driving perfectly torqued wont come time dont indent cotter pin blueorange type thread locker bolt thread come
subaru ftlbs torque wrench yes indent chisel punch
nah grab mig bead
thanks help everyone
yes always indent youre removing try remove indent itll scrape shit axle coming remove without

hi ive always wondered car slightly rev start basically start engine rev lever fluctuate ever slightly eventually drop lowest point happen also wait stop fluctuating set
rev lever
cole start high idle feature warm catalytic converter theyre efficient within certain temperature range meet emission warm quickly possible
deleted
normal unless excessive drive asap damage long car isnt year old
modern car computer rev engine variety reason electrical power regulation etc addition mentioned
enrichment cycle start cold engine itll need bit fuel start first time idle higher moment thing warm idle drop back normal level new thing car almost year way back carburetor old carburetor manual choke lever knob needed engaged timing lever needed adjusted started vehicle would left engine warm enough turned even motorcycle use version carbureted engine electronic choke thatll exact thing car higher rpm start slowly lower engine warms completely normal
think often speed heating catalytic converter one study claimed first minute cold start vehicle emits pollutant km nonstop drive warm engine largely due cold converter
unless live extremely cold climate modern oil protect engine startup cold dont need let idle yes high idle cold warms faster driving car warm faster idling point idling unless something
rich afr quick converter warmup aid combustion fuel vaporizes poorly cold combustion chamber lacking ambient heatenergy allow rich afr air added raising rpm dont wait drop idle especially vehicle different parameter eg one car start drop within second another keep idle coolant minimum warm range even gear itll keep higher idle quit immediately gear
im gonna tell mechanic think problem rev lever next time go
car guess trying push thicker cold engine oil circulate engine since oil pump almost ice car directly connected crankshaft rpm directly related engine rev higher spin oil pump faster generate higher oil pressure
high idle itll reach proper temperature

kind stupid take ive seen turbochargers diesel engine last hour operation regular maintenance good oil proper warm cooldown procedure make difference world
know replace turbo right lol
would worried cvt transmission speed automatic alot reliable done plenty turbos well turbo fail one day youll replace part wear need replaced
vehicle honda accord exl mile thought heard noise bearing turning yesterday put summer tire today checked driver side definitely play little whats considered normal definitely daily driver need car every day next week since dont day im trying figure bad idea keep driving another week mile day bearing like use different car fix know there definite answer guy give im looking rough idea rate loose scale normal fall offid say around
people might keep driving issue really depends far bearing worn condition youre driving bearing failure usually happens three stage overheating vibration noise looseness get bad enough could lead complete breakdown super dangerous especially higher speed youre driving around town risk might feel urgent still gamble bearing could fail time cause damage repair could end costing lot time money best avoid high speed stay road speed limit mph drive carefully keep driving watch bump since make thing worse pay attention whether noise get louder steering start feel there vibration driving notice getting worse best stop driving get fixed immediately getting fixed soon possible safest option need part selection wheel bearing might work check websitehttpbearingsdirectcom safety isnt something gamble know plenty people drive worse issue doesnt mean good idea car wouldnt wait longer necessary
former certified auto mechanic yes definitely need get checked fixed eventually fail cant predict probably next week seen people drive bad bearing month dont cajones big brassy
probably fine could drive regularly next week without issue especially since noise small started get addressed safe might well replace opposite wheel bearing time
likely itll fine wont catastrophically fail next week anything also yeah nobody predict future sometimes seems like half mechanic fielding question like everyone wanting u psychic andor tell want hear realistically probably fine also know
even asking wheel bearing asking stranger could go wrong wheel could fall know
stated there way giving official answer know there risk bearinghub might fail completely driving point cause damage vehicle expensive repair might also increased risk accident lose control vehicle either way need towed point option might consider dropping car repair shop day carpool coworker get dropped
week probably fine absolutely option especially truly started making noise wouldnt wait longer hub shear youre world hurt financially possibly literally
noticed rumble kmh month back vibration steering wheel though mechanic said point fine keep driving actually recommended wait couldnt tell side bearing failing symptom needed develop bit sure side need replacing
every day drive loose wheel bearing risk damaging thing avoid freeway speed
drove subaru forester mile ever increasing sound coming multiple wheel bearing knew car end life wasnt going drop part
went truck mile turn wheel bearing going thought tire making noise first due wear clicked head bearing loose making humming noise mph also getting hot touch also noticeable resistance spinning jacked probably took month driving realized honestly said slop bearing play youre getting dangerous territory wheel bearing hub assembly integral keeping wheel physically attached vehicle would work soon side safety isnt worth risking may get damage complete failure first replacement took hour second took itll save time long run
ive one seize young stupid year ago im stupid got pretty western went luckily left hand front gq patrol australia kmh highway managed drive bush dont recommend get fixed theyre big job wanker

order even remove transmission get torque converter theyll likely drop whole front subframe engine transmission bottom vehicle theyre necessary disassembly car yo mile transmission much simpler easier replace entire transmission
personally wouldnt replace converter mileage typically time shudder send debris system
mean sometimes replace torque converter lot time best replace transmission especially failing torque converter dumping material transmission
find independent transmission specialist aamco never dealer highest rated transmission shop thats within mile dealer ever want sell brand new factory transmission plus labor rate super high aamco like never priced fairly find johnson smith transmission whatever theyll actually know problem thats

lot advice youre getting generally true however camry known issue torque converter cause shudder experience toyota torque converter alone common replacement year camry even higher mileage plenty toyota dealer replaced torque converter even go somewhere else get replaced would try make sure get updated design replace part number newer
sure converter shuddering locked
bad shudder occasional remedy full rebuild replacement would try filter fluid change flush friction modifier added something like shudder fix possible option go worked although different vehicle occasional shudder
time could use fluid like shudder fix see fix problem shuddering isnt bad
suggest consult top hood electronics guy often really often transmission shudder torque converter shudder electronic issue make feel like transmissiontorque converter issue check fluid brownblack smell burnt torque converter two set fan blade nothing less fluid pressure increase pressure lock front set vane rear set usually contaminated fluid would damage convertermetal good luck
common camry abuse car
started shudder replacing torque converter replacing fluid fix driven extended period time torque converter begin clog filter metal causing clutch slip burn

bought tire im wanting lower bit without messing suspension tire calculator say change clearance inch say diameter differs dangerous try look different tire
thats difference thats great change engine higher rpm lower speed speedometer mph
long tire diameter youll fine make getting truck little easier
wouldnt change size much imagine speedometer inaccurate result couldnt tell much
make sure four tire size calibrate speedometer
speedometer wheel gap bigger otherwise long size wont harm also cruising rpm increase potentially costing little gas highway remember builtin mpg calculation wrong speedometer odometer wrong
throw speedometer lot thats big change also going look goofy physically lower truck little going also make gap top tire wheel well larger might end looking raised lowered
significant difference tire diameter significant difference radius tire geometry working
dont forget sidewall load rating least
said tire youre looking get four full inch shorter whats youre gonna believe weird going look tire size correct appropriate size speedometer useless past mph want lower bit highly advise would still drastic possibly tolerable shorter tire

none thing mentioned would call issue simple maintenance item due amount time andor distance like need new brake km something failed entirely likely go another need brake likely havent failed theyve simply worn last year wear shoe couple year wear like go doctor new foot simply replace normal wear item shoe fresh one continue value car going reduced repair needed unless fail disclose repair nobody going buy car need worth work discount cover work hassle im assuming car fully paid point amount maintenance per year divide less car payment better keep car almost always financially beneficial drive car completely dead buying another maintenance repair almost never cost new car
euro thats whole lot absolutely repair especially since thing fixed standard wear item seems like youre falling sort gambler fallacy fact youre fixing thing doesnt make car less reliable future way around euro youll car brand new brake new oil new belt different story whatever reason really comfortable getting used car option would get new one well thats stupid need stop stupid five year old toyota corolla likely reliable brand new vag car replacing car need euro worth fixing brand new car would incredibly stupid sound lot like want new car thats fine dont lie would stupid decision buy new car
new car comparable segment would cost nowadays item listed normal wear part there nothing wrong car used car would unknown quantity may prove poor choice tell fix quoted price isnt high either country like austria
man basic maintenancewear item youre small step away fuel tank empty id get new car one stress enough issue theyre normal wear item depending specific brake actual oil leak euro could reasonable well assume went independent garage dealership former tend better rate knowledge nothign wrong preferring new car there comforting factor big purchase cant beat buy used every car ive bought come dozen item need addressing thats dont care enjoy taking care everyone feel way

definitely dont without permission tenant never make electrical change permanent change kind ask landlord willing make change could even offer help pay interested thats decision fyi properly moving fixture work think doubtful enough existing wiring move want cant terminate add wire existing wiring make reach without adding unsightly junction box rewiring everything light switch possibly one could shorten wire make work depending run ceiling compared island wouldnt know got chance wired position would give excess wire versus enough wire long shot would also potentially significant amount drywall removed patched depending way ceiling joist run spacing joist compared centered island youre aware absolutely attempting rewire someone elses property
imagine dog leash dont want move dog move far leash imagine electrical device stuck wall light move much wire allow ish
take string pull side dont keep hitting head maybe tie two light run way something attach
pendant lamp hang chain want make one shorter tie link together
move island
would imagine landlord aware someone lack planning put stamp approval would minor pain move one would involve patching ceiling depending one skill would different kind eyesore moving two would double effort based wiring romex rigid conduit turn major project simpler solution would shorten another would eliminate one fixture cover box cover plate

dont pay technician took time hisher day something flat rate shop really equivalent reaching pocket taking dollar two wouldnt hurt least tipped part people would never consider number one cause mistake occurring shop well timed interruption something tech easily brief lapse concentration repair presently performing come outside source mentally equivalent going store desire get group item forgetting one two worst happen shopping goof need make another trip interrupting technician could result mistake cause repair fail actually lead destruction another customer engine always people blame technician error mistake regardless actually transpired reduce mistake shop shop dont allow customer access tech
wouldnt use gas station air compressor arent accurate pressure even digital also maintained ive seen various state working good emergency beat buying fix flat crap live arizona pay air couldnt reach tire shop st recommend buying little compressor itll pay ever catch nail something need limp tire shop lot new car dont spare id heavily recommend buying anyways
air generally free sure run compressor there maintenence take minute fill ur tire nothing mechanic generally cool topping ur tire free maybe next time give tip dollar would appreciate never know might make friend find urself good mechanic
used quite common every gas station free air tire mechanical shop would always gladly simply good business people patronize future treat right dad owned gas station quite well running used tire shop would always fill four tire customer anyone stopped tire low might offer check see leaking air always free place pay machine ask one direct guess always nice get free air buck tip never hurt shop doesnt routinely make tip buck probably big deal old gas station could pretty well tipwise kid would always offer check air tire watch windshield gas customer guess kind cute well tip pretty good obligation couple buck nice gesture put air maybe much two buck isnt much maybe could say hey get cup coffee
payment gas station little help needed maintenance compressor quick service garage free already make enough maintain equipment theyre also happy help someone free
worked shop year part manager would always fill free anyone came would buy stuff inside would wait tire filled properly kind go long way know people came back repair eventually line humble shop
im nc even notorious scammer mechanic dont problem filling tire free

important aspect used car make model previous owner
looking general consensus boosting vehicle leave donor vehicle engine connecting jumper cable turn start cable connected
ill long jump car battery still providing power connect prefer connect dead car first also help jumper cable unplug middle plug together side connected side note never heard called boosting thought talking stealing putting turbo supercharger car
jumping always donor car running
donor car connection deeply discharged battery drag charged one starting engine first ensures donor battery ish volt stay matter drained battery
thought boosting vehicle slang stealing
happy opinion corrected expert electricity car taught long ago either way usually fine however donor car weak battery battery cant provide necessary amp start dead car extra draw come alternator draw much could damage alternator donor car therefore taught start donor car connect po po neg ground neg grounded preferably unpainted bolt something farther away battery case spark let donor car charge dead battery minute pleasant conversation turn donir car start dead car disconnect reverse sequence start donor car never caused problem ive also never heard anyone destroying alternator way
important part boosting vehicle lookout dont get caught cop serious note yes leave donor car
search term little remove boost vehicle instead search jumpstart vehicle yes doner vehicle running adding jump cable
leave running constant flow current alternator turn lessens dead vehicle drag donor vehicle battery also avoids starter motor drawing donor vehicle battery ive hearing called boosting ever since kid
never engine running donor car booster pack dont engine necessary run donor car engine donor car battery fine seen damage alternator generator required supply cranking current dead car ignition key switch prevents damaging spike harming electronics donor car
wont say ive jump started vehicle ive done share always kept donor vehicle running careful keep hand cable clear wait minute start recipient car disconnect
boosting vehicle mean committed grand theft auto go jail think mean jumping automobile jumper cable
instruction usually tag owner manualif youre worried follow vehicle specific instruction due sensitive electronics follow instruction ordinarily hook terminal directly cut resistive loss keep good vehicle running high idle prior cranking dead vehicle may hold couple thousand rpm minute battery dead time best method hook charger charge overnight jump subsequent normal use may may get charged enough charging overnightsmart charger ensures back fully charged
pop hood connect cable dead car first donor leave donor car running need max power alternator let sit second longer battery really dead start target vehicle pull cable fast ground first shut hood get drive like soon
regardless ground car negative side first applying positive article saying connected positive first creates chance floating ground damage sensitive circuitry modern car
proper way would start donor vehicle cable hooked lessens voltage differential voltage spike
get jumper box already
latter safety standpoint dont want deal moving part connecting cable
installing new window regulator window sits piece arent high enough would get higher

little bit background ase certified technician year experience never engineer fail repair happened replace coolant expansion tank mercedes gls repair test drove vehicle make sure heat worked properly temperature go normal operating temperature customer came back next day vehicle overheating drove vehicle use tow service inspection noticed one hose blown clamp still installed hose filled coolant installed new clamp good warm cycle monitoring coolant temp scan tool took vehicle long test drive issue cleared code double checked coolant level good customer returned within minute white smoke bellowing exhaust flashing cel cylinder misfiring coolant temp range reservoir full pulled plug found coolant head gasket obviously compromised feel like due diligence know responsibility mine wish customer pulled called tow truck initial overheating concern could done differently
much really happen best u try warn customer stop immediately issue call always best bet work moving forward fix issue quickly properly get rental needed apologize bill dime solution reputation priceless industry solve issue like define neighborhood
replaced bad expansion tank originally caused fail first place cracked may pressurized saw result combustion gas seeping coolant passage repair test drove brought temperature working properly running correct temperature returned assume filled normal capacity coolant made sure thermostat opened returned routine practice year sure competent return visit normal time good possibility head gasket compromised drove shop first time pressurized may damaged tank first place leaking customer may driving around low coolant level would meant air system result hot spot air becomes trapped causing head gasket become damaged customer never come say coolant reservoir damaged call garage notice something driving steam hood temp gauge running abnormally high suspect may head gasket starting fail came door thing see possibly responsible missing symptom repair would whether caught early later seem done everything correctly dont hard looking back possibly thing could done differently would perform test co coolant bottle came first time maybe thats way approaching overheating issue working old subarus year positive engine full coolant showing symptom occasion returned customer think responsible gasket failure cost repair come handle relationship customer work year trust work business ethic would sit explain failing head gasket break seal intermittently get progressively worse may caught initial symptom occurring front mean caused
make sure fan run post repair procedure working cooling part whenever worked cooling system burping would monitor temp visually gauge mostly scanner seldomly car check hand upper hose waiting thermostat open watching fan kick would declare burping complete reached point upper radiator hose hot coolant flowing fan running would also make sure hand heater hose hot sorry deal suck blame even couldve prevented stopped driving forgot mention would turn heat temp fan speed low mentioning suspect fan turning caused car overheat blow hose
correct tstat function thermostat failed closed position cause hose blow due overpressure
one hose clamp tightened reason replacing expansion tank get overheated tank replaced
purge air mercedesbenz requires vacuum fill sometimes accompanied small manual procedure secondary electric pump purged correctly high acceleration highway trapped air bubble could possibly cause damage
thing say certainty reld tested hcs radiator confirm head gasket blown could pretty much guaranteed customer drove vehicle long overheating could previous issue im sure im also unsure german car worked dont think coolant overflow could cause air get tank maybe could connected hose right causing air trapped cooling system know check cooling fan properly bleed cooling system heater fan low confirm air bubble escaped hose hot definitely possible cause could caused overheating incident air system would blown hose would intermittent randomly shot temp guage max nowhere everyone callback career hopefully far least youre replacing head gasket head machined good hopefully shop insurance
mistake happen right taking chin

absolutely skip dealer go good independent nothing complex suspension likely needing alignment
could check fcpeuro price would recommend getting oem strut hate people put generic strut ride height wonky would go shop specializes suspension seems early needing strut maybe rough life would replace ball joint bushing refresh everything
rather common job shop issue
take independent get cheaper job better quality work dealer gone as work quality due paying staff imo find private mechanic go beyond find right one
tire center best place daily alignment together usually best price tv lounge

corolla im planning selling mechanically perfect condition ive done repair maintenance daily thing hood headlight atrocious im hoping restore headlight hood paint clear coat destroyed im wondering replace hood sell way would get money change hood would waste time money
waste time hood headlight diy hack bug spray spray scrub towel might take couple round theyre clear use something put protective coat wax ceramic detail spray fine toothpaste also work basically mild abrasive
youd likely able sell higher price may wash consider part labor get fixed
paint
look like total shit rattlecan itll probably also look bad better
buy kit fix headlight leave hood corolla recommended car ever someone buy
agree others hood would waste time effort wont increase sale value make worth headlight however would make world difference cleaned im huge fan diy would actually see walmart near auto care center headlight restoration u im assuming youre u price absolutely worth let done vehicle one even year old civic came good new
ive lot work car hood also bad shape cracked paint need stripped repainted dont intend sell time soon repainting would selling probably wouldnt paint although id first check whether could recoup cost soughtafter car thats increasingly hard find internals solid case might actually pay maybe
find matching one great shape thats big cosmetic issue sure waste time
wrap hood polish headlight
possibly find hood match fairly cheap pull yard otherwise wrap attempt rattle match wrap much safer bet headlight restoration kit cheap
headlight yes would anything hood reason repainting even professional would judged suspicion people immediately think vehicle sort accident lot car paint issue since government mandated waterborn auto paint
year find clean one scrapyard like perhaps worth
went thing recently corolla mile ran like new hood clear coat left building paint started peeling headlight fogged debated painting self can clear coat junkyard hood condition ended selling car friend kid want maximize payout might worth didnt want deal personally
try sell hard time get new used hood paint frugal possible
year color toyota issue white paint repair free sometimes
reason didnt include year model mileage

much water sell something called heet dry isopropyl alcohol designed mix water might need one bottle depending much water also water already fuel line nothing tow shop drained
first try start car even turn key much bigger bill tow car shop choice remove tank drain try siphon water get tow car give anyone key turn ignition key fuel pump may start cleaning line fuel injection etc
dont start car go harbor freight get siphoning pump siphon gas add fresh gas pray dont go mechanic
serious conversation dad would one put water gas first place label

depending much water add gallon isopropyl alcohol
fuel system return tank wouldnt push water sucked pump return back tank mix dry gas treatment holding accelerator pedal floor cranking engine would turn fuel injector prevent water entering engine allowing go back fuel tank also clear anything might entered cylinder clear flood mode unless like gallon water dont see wouldnt work im putting mind make sense dont see side trying
remove gas cap crawl car disconnect fuel line drain something refill gas get starting fluid spray intake cranking itll start sputter bit repeat stay running
start car turn key dont want fuel pump prime water pumplinesinjectorsetc wouldnt terrible idea pull fuel pump fusesrelays diy open fuel tank siphon everything flush couple time get much water add treatment filling entirely new fuel opening tank likely accessible underneath rear seat may need drop tank
heet drygas actually personally used judicious amount rubbing alcohol

pull fuel hose fuel rail engine bay hot wire fuel pump pump liquid gas tank run stop pumping anything refill tank gasoline completely full reconnect fuel line engine bay crank engine start might need put battery charger try start time running let idle minute drive bit fill tank fresh gas

id tell waive labor charge boot install
change wheel bearing would exact process get axle boot theyre either unqualified blatantly ripping axle boot dont grind hold grease axle click eventually pop failing dont grind correct original assessment could changed bearing charged extra min boot time crook shop owner
put old axle back charge replace bearing screwed need eat like many others question long mechanical work year never heard wheel bearing thought bad axle
pull axle return part distributor made bad call didnt proper diagnostic would eat labor case still going fighting uphill battle though could complain upper management depending shop sadly likely going eat cost take car somewhere else isnt going screw
ask provide labor wheel bearing free youll pay part credit back labor axle boot thats fair request dont go back shop cant tell difference cv axle failure wheel bearing noise
smart thing would spin bearing axle removed said best luck
report bar agreement met always customer want first even think something else would advise warranty want
let would asked politely referral shop dy wheel bearing ive done youth like id old stuff without lift
ask credit back axle job least dont try scum saying fault agreeing let internet know operate
agreed axle repair want authorized repair thats bud wanted bearing replaced stood ground replace bearing
axle would needed replaced shortly unfortunate situation worst however good chunk labor get axle done includes majority would needed replace hub id say bearing replacement cost full labor know much part theyd considered owning overage concurrent repair
unless writing proof screwed theyre gonna win case thats shitty mechanic try best bet refund everything there guarantee didnt damage anything wont damage thing
im mechanic knew opposite turn wheel bearing would use
bureau automotive repair shop owner like
couldve bought torque wrench bearing press replaced
diagnosed replaced didnt fix problem wouldnt pay bill

day noticed one wheel lock lug missing last service done car rotation rebalance discount tire like mi ago im assuming didnt torque lock worked one college period time told u tighten torque wheel lock bc guy messing key andor lock sure thats still policy im guessing thats happened know lock dont shit far preventing theft feel like replace honestly give new set dont deal two stupid key late complain shouldnt pay bc idiocy ive several set custom valve cap fly bc didnt tighten well didnt bother complaining
well call make complaint see handle say thought titty month burden proof really worth going court max dollar new set wheel lock
first step would put key socket turn see actually loose go ahead call store lug tight cant necessarily blame missing one lot thing could happened mile like someone attempting steal wheel
pulled put back place sends written warning invoice torque feww hundred mile aluminum mag current rim notorious expansion contraction along shit metal stud nut made didnt get memo

car parchases dealer far currently car want sell one maybe two ive posted marketplace received hundred message serious people ive listed car great price people see think get car even less discounted price listed dealer trade rate super low well looking sell people shopping car willing pay market value without lowballing beyond reason
list way higher want marketplace weed people maybe someone else make reasonable offer
auto trader private exchange legit took month two sold mine easy process
found difficult sell nice car locally got usual low ball offer think lot people rely financing even fairly cheap car youre looking sell might better luck remember selling work
find another place made buy sell carsfacebook marketplace terrible place car due youll find worst people
curious car area world youre havent issue selling subk car town facebook marketplace car would much harder sell area low cost living iowa
lot scammer marketplace still best option market everything terrible nobody money buy anything either give time lower price kbb give recommended price
sold two car last three month marketplace first received two interested party one paid full asking price dream transaction nd car received bunch noise obnoxious nearby dealership also asked buy car ended selling one discount asking price wasnt excited
still sell dealer consignment mean take percentage sale continue theyve sold usually mean theyre interested getting good price youll walk away way youd get tradein normally still little less private sale basically hassle risk handed dealer instead
well first buy car reasonably sell individual want sell later mean either beater grand something special someone buy cash buy pickup truck fully loaded grand going unreasonably difficult find someone hand grand cash year later youll sell dealership who buying resell profit thus pricing know youre relatively hard buyer theyre pricing buy beater buy car plan keep forevergive friend family youre done buy legit cool car everything else go unless youre willing take massive hit coming going
engine keep dying use usually idle occurs rain couple hour use water getting engine bay would cause

ev motor compact phev ev motor pathetically weak im sure engineer right im wrongam underestimating size complexity adding hp electric motor drive gen chevy volt baffling tiny economy car ev power ev motor huge modern german luxury phev car driver made list phevs ev mode result laughable linkhttpswwwcaranddrivercomnewsatoyotapriusprimepluginhybridslowevaccelerationtest imagine accelerating onramp mb gle hp empty without sufficient power car arguably dont true ev mode like volt make wonder hard would slap bigger ev motor incredibly convenient waking mile ev range filling road trip id love see convenience contemporary model usable ev power new carreddit please let know there better place techengineering question
battery
motor isnt issue rest send enough amperage motor create torque need enough battery power need big enough wire need controller designed thing add weight cost fit shit combustion engine shit ev one car there limited space fit cant use battery pack controller big enough send large enough amount energy motor quickly enough
european city day kph speed limit street live place like horsepower enough get around town enable ice get onto highway need go faster
lot luxury car ev mode designed crawl city gas engine ban city london instance ev motor crawl mph less add gas engine
honestly small electric motor would make biggest impact basically crawling city want power get tundra hybrid hibrid drive add hp isnt help milage
combination thing alot determined powerful battery ie quickly discharge properly power motor doesnt make alot sense put powerful ev motor phev since also ice thats main power source generally speaking think there also complexity putting powerful motor combustion engine assist given could theoretically overrun engine unless cap motor youve invested powerful motor cant use time
imagine accelerating onramp mb gle hp thing dont car also gas engine available get six second theoretically gas tank empty youd stuck slower electric motor would fault letting happen youre much likely drain battery gas tank youd gas engine performance volt make better use electric motor circumstance like long hill may require running gas engine maintain full power youre stuck limited electric power gas engine isnt adding gle would cruising easily using turbocharged engine audi phev sluggish electric mode rare thats issue driving electric mode fine acceleration needed gas engine take seem odd dont get electric engine overall work
weight v cost would making car heavy youre getting diminishing return range per dollar
accelerating freeway speed ice heavy lifting thats use case ev mode hybrid lot hybrid tiny motor bevs typically use system youd use ev mode driving around town speed limit usually mph especially spend lot time waiting traffic light driving block stopping there need lot power cut wear tear ice unwanted emission want electric power get bev
one pointing cost gle start upgrade like hp electric motor probably another plus address item people point battery etc

sound like bad idea going encourage unsafe even reckless driving like say good part would route creator share nice driving route id careful include anything timing related though
shouting strava run red youre attempting kom invalidate ticket
use google map create route put checkpoint tick drive past quite cumbersome doesnt always work want sorta job id love app sharing fun driving route like others said id leave timing stuff kinda promotes reckless driving
could nice depending well everything integrated route creation tool would really core feature mind integrated navigation system get route drive together would also nice idea allow people get place together setting meetup waypoint set time letting people leave get waypoint set time guess shouldnt make app car centric bikers might interested also bikers apps exists gpx route everything could benchmark get feature inspo think would mandatory fun include need speed like disclaimer app load

dont trade low mile accord sell privately within hour probably
great accord kind end dominance japanese especially honda car era nice one getting newish hyundai kind downgrade stick shift coupe oh man fucking best theyre going offer like buck something stupid low try trade someone work dealership going buy personal car stoked
accord model year old dealership going give shit new transmission tire fresh oil change give much bigger trade value youd lucky get trade allowance car probably sell auction honestly youve told u basically fuckall overtakencareof accord actually year long time normal maintenance item crop doesnt really sound like youve done much anything car needed transmission order remain drivable thats part normal maintenance would car need new transmission less mile anyway seal talking specifically tire wear item need periodically replaced anyway regular oil change standard practice youve done nothing noteworthy spark plug coolant power steering fluid brake fluid end link shock strut ball joint engine cabin air filter think dont know youre talking
accord well took good care almost mile dealership offering around like could probably get much even got told dealership sell third party would definitely get money think thats best thing especially mile could probably get good amount however car could also last good amount longer keep taking care car last forever lol
would never trade car like dealer sell privately double money take money pay car loan quickly genesis depreciating asset paying year interest make financial sense whoever bought car new suffered depreciation already

grew il chicago area whenever tire low air would go close auto shop ask fill tire dont mean tire flat like low pressure colder weather ive never pay im currently living az tucson area gf driving low pressure light go one tire way party directed shop pull explain need one tire filled rest guy quickly fill tire give thumb leave gf tell shes never gone shop tire filled usually pay quarter gas station ask couple friend party theyve air filled shop say ever gone gas station fuck paid guy im really questioning paid took advantage shop normal thing go shop ask tire filled
totally normal
normal shop try make pay one avoid like plague little gl air compressor ive filled go help people road side flat im mechanic also air fucking free someone try asking pay leave thing nitro fill
slightly annoying time definitely normal tech year people everywhere
dont pay technician took time hisher day something flat rate shop really equivalent reaching pocket taking dollar two wouldnt hurt least tipped part people would never consider number one cause mistake occurring shop well timed interruption something tech easily brief lapse concentration repair presently performing come outside source mentally equivalent going store desire get group item forgetting one two worst happen shopping goof need make another trip interrupting technician could result mistake cause repair fail actually lead destruction another customer engine always people blame technician error mistake regardless actually transpired reduce mistake shop shop dont allow customer access tech
wouldnt use gas station air compressor arent accurate pressure even digital also maintained ive seen various state working good emergency beat buying fix flat crap live arizona pay air couldnt reach tire shop st recommend buying little compressor itll pay ever catch nail something need limp tire shop lot new car dont spare id heavily recommend buying anyways
air generally free sure run compressor there maintenence take minute fill ur tire nothing mechanic generally cool topping ur tire free maybe next time give tip dollar would appreciate never know might make friend find urself good mechanic
used quite common every gas station free air tire mechanical shop would always gladly simply good business people patronize future treat right dad owned gas station quite well running used tire shop would always fill four tire customer anyone stopped tire low might offer check see leaking air always free place pay machine ask one direct guess always nice get free air buck tip never hurt shop doesnt routinely make tip buck probably big deal old gas station could pretty well tipwise kid would always offer check air tire watch windshield gas customer guess kind cute well tip pretty good obligation couple buck nice gesture put air maybe much two buck isnt much maybe could say hey get cup coffee

like title say way ever since alternator replaced new one keep buy new battery battery immediately fixed connecting another car battery via jump charge time needed last month week week day dividing lifespan time recharge battery dealership stumped dont know new alternator wrong anyone help figure wrong car would save idea hyundai elantra sport
need go shop starting charging system checked dont go autozone possible alternator bad new doesnt mean good
alternator connection bad way battery die going road using charge power car receiving charge alternator depletes battery guess failing voltage regulator car old enough ever see battery symbol dash mean alternator charging battery test alternator car well outside
battery dy driving battery weak jump start needed
take independent shop diagnosing dealer doesnt always best tech
sound like new alternator shit
im agreement independent shop taking peek quickly tell health current alternator battery short descriprion sound like parasitic draw pretty easy competent shop diagnose diagnosis would money well spent instead aggravation causing seen simple harness problem cause youre familiar type troubleshooting good knowledgeable shop best bet could simply intermittent connection good shop guide check battery post cablescheck belt especially alternator connection
badloose connection somewhere bad internal voltage regulator would voltage drop test cable connection going hard truly diagnose info given u battery voltage dy car go completely dead dealership replaced tried different alternator
volt battery car running
guess parasitic draw somewhere vehicle usually random mention happens car
car alternator alternator harness issue gotten multiple bad alternator row dealer one three diode alternator usually fails check fuse also seen radio trunk release switch cause battery drain thing run people stupid trying fix charging battery drain issue usually intermittent see santa fe lot near year range
maybe new alternator broken serpentine belt loose spinning alternator
year model car car known issue contribute problem example new beetle problem cable alternator battery failing replace battery alternator cable
im issue wont hold charge new battery tried putting new alternator still wont hold charge someone said could compression board forgot exact name oem maybe said like brain car telling alternator charge battery part isnt expensive change software shop need reset system costly hear start battery doesnt stay charged long light come battery start im afraid drive anywhere fear getting stalled needing tow someone said go shop say need new battery alternator etc etc charge money instead tell main compression board
take alternator battery autozone bench test could cable problem alternator battery vws problematic odd way
modern charging system controlled engine management system aka computer part guy diagnostic expert chance figuring dealer stumped find different dealer cause dont clue hour complete check ecu see capable controlling alternator
someone need voltage drop testing top head id say wire generator output back battery disconnected high resistance reason
similar problem changed battery changed alternator come find bolt hole new battery negative terminal wasnt deep original didnt realize tight wasnt clamping cable end always start kiss methodology keep simple stupid working space ship
another way see atinator working dis object one battery terminal engine running atinator working stall engin
im issuesi chevy tahoei purchased truck december still batterybut truck doesnt start morning aaa said need new battery sometimes start month straight go back starting againone time driving made turn stopped truck shut started playing cable battery wire minute started

terminal corroded clean anyways get electrical contact cleaner local auto part store give whole thing good spray clean corrosion wire brush connection youre pulling battery spray side battery clean well leave terminal clean dry vaseline make big mess shouldnt going battery quickly youve probably got issue voltage know somebody voltmeter check battery voltage car running voltage top would bet youve got much voltage running battery cooking go autozone contact cleaner could probably check voltage
repair light sound straight forward consider looking car needed battery year becoming corroded reasonably excuse many battery would car sits really long time drive constantly ran flat otherwise might dealing parasitic draw charging issue wiring problem battery car thats regularly driven month last year depending quality cared
hey title say day ago car chevy aveo engine thermostat started reach max every time would immediately stop driving would pop hood feel radiator along hose would cool touch sign smoke also topped radiator coolant also check engine light also would start driving around heater full blast thermostat would read full please help dont want drive around car engine potentially overheating thank
sound like stuck thermostat
would say water pump overheating immediately know coolant thermostat probably wouldnt overheat instantaneously little bit bypass
fyi thermostat part cooling system located hood coolant temperature gauge dashboard
sound like bad thermostat youre reading dash temperature gauge thermostat thermostat engine regulates coolant flow radiator required keep operating temp since radiator hose cold either thermostat isnt opening water pump failed
reading engine coolant temperature thermostat
check see radiator full coolant
check coolant radiator engine completely cold open radiator cap see coolant fill search leak coolant start engine coolant start move water pump defective thats okay might defective thermostat remove thermostat put housing back let drive put new one always test new thermostat stove installing suspend pot water isnt touching bottom check water temperature open get boil hasnt opened defective doesnt open near rated temperature defective lot new thermostat defective new shelf
chevy silveradoguage show engine overheating ac shuts engine cooling component cool touch replaced thermostat everything went back normal explained thermostat today fail open position youre overheating thermostat doesnt close vehicle cant maintain operating tempeture
friend issue loaner ev r model guess isnt charging everyones vague abt company said dont trickle charge past like bc there failsafe something idk said id ask around tldr he confused rule abt charging since he always used ice

would wait mile personally would drain fill around mile would complete flush sure revenue generator also beneficial life transmission
probably would drain fill every thats honda recommends
waiting mile ridiculous shop wont want touch fluid get old much want flush fluid im sure simple drainrefill service would fine well sure shop us prescribed oem tranny fluid service shop using dont let jiffy lube quick lube joint touch car
agreed follow ford recommendation
doubt refer whoever give warranty cant imagine shop giving warranty ford say
never flushed trans suggests similar interval

tried pressure washer
else fails use muriatic acid wash concrete wire brush pressure washer youll need area ensure uniformity likely take easily
time machine youre invest bitcoin fixed mark thread solved
product info sheethttpscontentsyndigocomassetcebcfafcbdfbcaaoriginalpdf maybe chemist could direct reasonable solutionmethod
heat gun scraper something like goo gone desperate acetone
wire brush solvent like mineral spirit may work pour small amount solvent green stuff let soak hit wire brush
work well fluid ounce adhesive remover httpswwwlowescompdkleanstripflozadhesiveremover
acidic acid industrial strength white vinegar sold home depot soften remove water base paint oil base paint concrete wear mask lot fume used vinegar ti clean concrete inside home ore tile setter laid set tile
worst case rent concrete grinder bit less abrasive floor polisher stiff brush muriatic acid im issue rebuilt old ford door back patio sealer used awful like gumclayasbestos nothing clean tried tidy little piece everywhere smeared concrete even considered asking could expoy coat near pool would slippery
wire wheel grinder drill dont grinder
coarse sandpaper grit less oscillating sander metal file
hand sanitizer since alcohol work use one aloe wont hurt concrete
acetone
drill hard bristle drill bit try non metal ie wire brush brush first variable speed drill work best increase speed come come force always win
grey paint
risk sounding like simpleton goo gone
wire wheel grinder
similar different get old sticker bottom bathtub annoyingly stuck even goo gone razor blade eventually decided try rotary sander worked wonder

make mention car make model engine could easy reach might might jack car put jackstands reach sensor rusted place youll break trying remove issue carefully drill handy think handle crank sensor go bad engine start run many car wont even set code make doubt diagnosis especially pepboys counter person counter person mechanic salesperson selling part might need might fight replacement still problem
crank position sensor tend pretty basic unlikely fail would suspect harness connector issue replacing sensor may make problem appear go away may act unplugging sensor scraped corrosion pin fixed issue inspect harness connector spending money course always exception make model may notorious failing cps ymmv

hello fellow poster chevy hhr mile symptom battery vehicle charge volt regardless long vehicle driven battery warranty replaced matter good practice part store replaced charge without testing original symptom remained new battery charged externally charger negative terminal removed take full hold charge volt feel confident alternator regulator defective question battery circuit motor idling using volt meter good ground positive lead voltage would would expect read im guessing something north volt voltage low say volt alternator regulator defective repair regulator alternator need replaced
battery read charged unless reading surface charge immediately disconnecting charging source wait minute test battery youve disconnected float charger good battery test ok battery test remove battery circuit cause voltage spike damage sensitive electronics battery circuit read engine running sometimes alternator problem intermittent make sure cable alternator battery tight free corrosion
vehicle running alternator charging battery voltage read vehicle battery fully charged read least battery voltage isnt vehicle running alternator probably longer charging
far replacing voltage regulator design incorporate alternator however trend newer model include regulator pcm ecm latter replacement computer likely need programing important properly identify setup vehicle replacement
dont jump alternator bad yet wouldnt old disconnect battery car run alternator trick anything newer cause damage vehicle hhr shouldnt additional voltage regulator battery ground like car alternator doesnt seem like belt ac related issue case either unless condition havent looked could failed ground battery connected multi meter setting one probe battery ground alternator also check engine block read volt number represents voltage loss value volt subtract volt goal leave closer case fixing bad ground replacing failed ground cable isnt possible run another cable battery negative block good ground chassis firewall
alternator charge volt also modern charging system controlled pcmecm actually turn alternator completely battery charged electrical demand low important know charging system work diagnosing another thing people look checking diode ripple load high load might charging fine low load one high load doesnt charge also check loose corroded connection voltage drop test easy multimeter
major auto part store charging system check free
take autozone ask test alternator handheld tester come hook free
dont thing battery current sensor line positive cable like go bad often

wanna get torque wrench torque cv axle nut need foot lb torque torque wrench top foot lb heard something inaccuracy lower higher torque range use one maximum foot lb torque wrench torque axle nut inaccurate know get different wrench large range trying see get typical lb torque wrench save money also get click split beam usage thanks
say lbft thats range acceptable mean need torque something lbft use tool said analytical chemist would never use one instrument far end calibration range there another option usually try avoid top bottom calibration range
range normally youre good go still use isnt guaranteed accurate
calibrate torque wrench among thing test range also exercise full scale prior calibration yes fine theyre less accurate end range usually theyre certified ive seen occasion
yes wouldnt say could youre every day twice gonna destroy thing make inaccurate start snappin screw top torque spec safety range
use split beam super fun trying put torque trying read gauge straight lining pointer
yes
go get free loaner local part store place problem solved
accuracy lower outside middle range depending application company limit middle bolt tension really critical measuring bolt stretch instead torque wrench anyway
use click type time id get bigger wrench sure foot lb correct value sound really high automotive axle also oddly specific like would sufficient
lose accuracy either end range cv axel nut isnt section xi im sure youll ok inaccuracy get clicker hf itll okay
maximum allowable torqueage
yes
probably fine say workplace aerospace use torque wrench max torque ramge
ftlb ftlb range near upper limit wrench although standard torque wrench calibrated accurately range error may occur near upper limit
wut
youre ever sure dont torque wrench sufficiently large rating get fairly close using lever length basic math ftlb pound applied end foot lever math much weight apply end however long breaker bar axle nut prior getting big torque wrench used online calculator see far breaker bar id need apply full body weight get torque spec measured length marked tape stood spot far perfect good enough government work answer question though torque wrench calibrated fine tend less accurate extreme end rating though
yes go ahead use work use digital torque wrench every wheel end im diesel mechanic trade shop fired guy refused torque wheel end also lug nut correctly lost wheel highway speed truck trailer peel car open like kid tearing snicker bar work car side cash torque every single axle nut lug nut someone get hurt going
yeah use ftlbs harm mechanical wrench break away put strain handle electronic wrench use strain gauge arent knocked unless actually bend shaft tool beyond plastic deformation good luck
im surprised one mentioned couple drop loctite always good peace mind plus bfb probably mm may mention torque spec likely pretty wide range well within accuracy wrench hand probably similar job future getting bigger wrench money well spent
torquing head gasket something really wanted ensure perfect would trust top end range application pretty sure cv bolt fine bit especially throw little loctite least blue dont spec something else
youll fine axle nut dont require critical accuracy
liked torque adapter idea bought
use bar pipe pull hard move
design break quit working whatever highest torque setting
id recommend digital tq adapter much easier use much cheaper plus often accuracy min max drive going ftlb
theyre accurate percent range overlapping range insure accuracy
max cv axle nut long youre relatively close itll fine usually put breaker bar hit big hammer goodntight
ive never replaced axle shop personal thing ive also never torqued cv tighten piss great advice probably better blowing apart internals wrench ive done probably cv mine buddy car never problem
would torque increment final would use split beam clicker digital anything come loose
ive heard go max number said shouldnt inaccurate even always look video perform accuracy test weight vice dont worry breaking axle nut stud say least want peace mind get paint pen paint line nut continue thread bit line broken week two know loose need retorque
ive never used torque wrench axle nut axle socket usually deep well prefer impact wrench avoid slippage

extremely expensive compared expensive per kg machine take long recharge vehicle compared older one there usually additional labor charge well thats actually pretty good price compared shop evac recharge
keep mind refrigerant stupid expensive
people already chiming case needed additional validation thats fine price ryf stupid expensive refrigerant addition older style machine cant use shop likely upgraded ac machine also huge cost enjoy cool breeze
ask would cost anything cannot charge whatever want without approval told fix thats actually pretty reasonable yf refrigerant pricey equipment needed pricey slow tedious process pay labor time
used yf thats call cheap like hazard tool requirement thank epa manufacturer
ac recharge also dangerous diy friendly thing also discharging refrigerant atmosphere illegal technically need shop ot
newer refrig price crazy
last time bought lb container yf cost bought theyre usually anywhere depending whether buy middle summer winter demand isisnt high buy lb thats huge price difference time charge slightly longer well expensive system around
pay hot whats issue
probably warranty extension compressor shaft seal condenser honda could leaking repaired recharged free know people think dealer devil would rather pay pocket
know industry refused use co far less dangerous substance refrigerant would cheap like money printing press
need add refrigerant circuit mean leaking sure didnt also repair leak there point adding refrigerant circuit leak repaired also illegal knowingly vent refrigerant atmosphere
remember back gmc acadia rolled needed rear evaporator super common refrigerant labor evaporator separately combined customer warranty like mile something like refrigerant pretty sure service manager helped bit felt bad barely service

kommt immer auch drauf ob lange beine oder sitzriese musste ausprobieren auch dran denken da oft ein glasdach auf kosten der kopffreiheit geht gibt auch auto mit verschiedenen sitzen je nach ausstattung der billige lt sich dann nicht vertikal verstellen der teure schon also beim ausprobieren auch auf die jeweilige ausstattung achten
schwierig zu sagen ich hab mit fast jedem auto probleme kenn aber auch grere leute bei denen e besser geht kommt halt immer drauf wie bei dir die krperbeineverteilung ist besten echt einfach ausprobieren

looking general consensus boosting vehicle leave donor vehicle engine connecting jumper cable turn start cable connected
ill long jump car battery still providing power connect prefer connect dead car first also help jumper cable unplug middle plug together side connected side note never heard called boosting thought talking stealing putting turbo supercharger car
jumping always donor car running
donor car connection deeply discharged battery drag charged one starting engine first ensures donor battery ish volt stay matter drained battery
thought boosting vehicle slang stealing
happy opinion corrected expert electricity car taught long ago either way usually fine however donor car weak battery battery cant provide necessary amp start dead car extra draw come alternator draw much could damage alternator donor car therefore taught start donor car connect po po neg ground neg grounded preferably unpainted bolt something farther away battery case spark let donor car charge dead battery minute pleasant conversation turn donir car start dead car disconnect reverse sequence start donor car never caused problem ive also never heard anyone destroying alternator way
important part boosting vehicle lookout dont get caught cop serious note yes leave donor car
search term little remove boost vehicle instead search jumpstart vehicle yes doner vehicle running adding jump cable
leave running constant flow current alternator turn lessens dead vehicle drag donor vehicle battery also avoids starter motor drawing donor vehicle battery ive hearing called boosting ever since kid
never engine running donor car booster pack dont engine necessary run donor car engine donor car battery fine seen damage alternator generator required supply cranking current dead car ignition key switch prevents damaging spike harming electronics donor car
wont say ive jump started vehicle ive done share always kept donor vehicle running careful keep hand cable clear wait minute start recipient car disconnect
boosting vehicle mean committed grand theft auto go jail think mean jumping automobile jumper cable
instruction usually tag owner manualif youre worried follow vehicle specific instruction due sensitive electronics follow instruction ordinarily hook terminal directly cut resistive loss keep good vehicle running high idle prior cranking dead vehicle may hold couple thousand rpm minute battery dead time best method hook charger charge overnight jump subsequent normal use may may get charged enough charging overnightsmart charger ensures back fully charged
pop hood connect cable dead car first donor leave donor car running need max power alternator let sit second longer battery really dead start target vehicle pull cable fast ground first shut hood get drive like soon
regardless ground car negative side first applying positive article saying connected positive first creates chance floating ground damage sensitive circuitry modern car
proper way would start donor vehicle cable hooked lessens voltage differential voltage spike
get jumper box already
latter safety standpoint dont want deal moving part connecting cable
weeeelllllll shoot im dreading answer go fj cruiser using torque wrench set ft lb put plug back draining kept spinning tried back thing sound like thread stripped inside transmission housing case okay fill drive next step

year old want learn optimal way driving young age benefit rest life currently one problem mind like drive fuel efficiently far pleasing see good mpg drive fast ive read sort tip common driving low rpm shifting neutral driving downhill immediately thought isnt bad engine sum question bad engine coast around rpm diesel engine bad engine leave neutral extended period time long slight hill area driving gear need throttle sidenote obviously shift neutral good view long distance around im trying keep safe possible
keep tyre pumped stop coasting neutral thats costing fuel saving
driving downhill neutral actually burn fuel leave gear going engine compression mode gear going select gear want desired effect coast slowly slow control descent etc engine wont burn fuel much fuel long getting input accelerator pedal going downhill also recommended enginetransaxletransmission neutral vehicle motion might need suddenly manoeuvre avoid something emergency diesel engine general suffer run neutralidling like gas engine
increasing following distance allows smoother use accelerator pedal save fuel gas gas gas gas tailgating another vehicle horrible fuel consumption
fuel consumption mostly related much pushing throtle push fuel go engine cruising need neutral gear since already easy throtle pop highest gear let car run way downhill use engine brake drive speed wanna go faster put high gear neutral drive neutral end using brake set brakepads gonna cost saved fuel neutral
lift coast
think really start collecting data running test im really sure much benefit youll actually get diminishing return
doesnt seem like fun
electronically injected engine ecu shutoff injector low engine load aka coasting putting neutral mean engine squirt fuel keep motor spinning note apply carbureted mechanically injected engine neutral probably us less fuel wash note coasting automatic fluid pump attached motor side risk damaging transmission shutting motor coasting neutral diesel burn well lean peak time gasoline motor specific condition make pulse glide effective gas motor sure necessary diesel get scan gauge whatever modern equivalent plug obd port real time look vehicle estimated mileage know people call lieometer relative basis extremely accurate multiple sensor correlating data
use cruise control
shifting neutral going downhill used work carbureted engine fuel injection direct port doesnt matter engine actually efficient leave gear bc injector shut momentum vehicle allow engine spin going neutral actually use fuel bc may intact fuel idle whereas fuel need injected coast gear
time moving trans gear better car safer engine help braking hill best advice give best safety fuel economy passenger comfort always work driving smoothly
drive easy
efficient range internal combustion engine throttle rpm edit start bit lower rpm diesel brake cost fuel go real fast stop literally wasted fuel accelerate fast stop accelerate whereas youre coasting high gear much speed use right amount fuel get next intersection mph instead accelerating stop accelerate hard easy go slower difference kmh kmh modern latter us half fuel like twice safe finally use neutral moving
drive like cup coffee dash dont want spill
drive drive normal youll get fine mpg anything driving safe could use part mind track nearby driver might go consider go need evade ect youll save money damage insurance potentially health drive defensivly
use cruise control safely ecu optimize mileage better foot lol
putting automatic transmission neutral coasting bad transmission automatic shuts transmission pump leave transmission lacking lubrication

year old im renting apartment unfinished cement floor basement one cat who litter box clean daily litter box sit basement earlier year cat sick peeing outside litter box quickly resolved smell still lingers sometimes whenever get bad storm entire house smell like cat piss whenever stop raining day smell completely gone dampness basement storm nothing crazy damp spot line wall tried nature miracle urine destroyer simple solution extreme cat stain eliminator odor neither seemed work well want get taken care house stop smelling like pee dont lose security deposit
dont know cement ive known someone success product called odoban purchased home depot extremely strong disinfectant odor remover ive used careful using say cause permanent eye damage
also post rcats see solution rcathelp
really need enzyme based cleaner break protein urine
nature miracle name one product break cat urine smell im sure others
soak area white vinegar use think need ive used year pet stain carpet never failed get rid smell
please completely close area deep cleaning ensure cat remains safe unharmed suggested cleaning solution particularly given application quantity likely toxic cat good luck
good experience product simple green outdoor odor eliminator odorcide thornell koe kennel odor eliminator angry orange pet odor eliminator please aware enzymatic product take time work sometimes several month high concentration dried urine urine crystallize onto fabric carpet fiber making removal challenging impossible likewise wick flooring pergo vinyl linoleum soak particleboard plywood cabinet vanity wall board point best remedy remove replace damaged material
youre using right product need use cat urine soaked concrete moisture rain pushing back point water cycling probably spread farther deeper need spread enough enzyme urine destroyer soak pad apply whole area like foot around place know cat peed

try stuff peroxide based let soak cement help lot dog accident ive tried one mentioned impressed httpswwwtargetcompbissellflozoxystaindestroyerpetforcarpetandupholsterya doesnt work keep kitty area id use straight household bleach let soak cement porous rain probably creating little pressure slab pushing old liquid bleach deactivated exposure air hazardous day
cat urinary problem would pee thing also foster kitten pee anywhere tried nature miracle bacout moderate success odoban didnt shit several others whose name dont remember didnt work either try pet peed stupid name good product cheap need couple gallon probably need get concrete saturated mean getting product pool concrete day two take several week work completely seriously might easier replace concrete
think would worth get odor removerhttpswwwamazoncomstorespageefaebbdbfccaeencodingutfpdrdplhdrtpdrdiblgktrefsbxbessparklessdasinstorerefsbvahicqjfxavmlzwfxbclpasinsblgktpdrdwtpfkpcontentidamznsymdefddbdecdaamznsymdefddbdecdpfrdpdefddbdecdpfrdrhjdkbkjtzgvpdrdwggmdvpdrdrbacbafccfaddafc meant commercial application dilute spray onto around affected area
issue elderly cat started peeing outside box thing unfinished basement cement cleaned well let dry completely used sealer never whiff since
enzyme cleaner straight peroxide else fails paint floor killz tint grey moved place hosted cat
depending live ive found petlab always worked
there chemical used photofinishing thing really work enzyme stuff sold pet accident waste money
little known fact bleach cat dont mix urinate often bleach simple solution patio decking stain odour remover jeyes fluid really good consumer one maldour yes thats brand sure sell general public
skouts honor urine destroyer really really work
cleaner odour remover still dont completely work youll seal concrete floor done long would prevented urine soaking low odour clear acrylic water based seal concrete floor wont obvious dry thatll stop odour rising
pour gallon vinegar swish around broom let dry worked ply wood floor
put newsprint soiled area dump baking top draw urine time keep repeating smell lessens here whats important understand odorant molecule cat urine easily displaced redistributed urine longer peed likely deposit black light help determine biggest problem

take short drive often allow engine come full operating temperature result moisture collecting mixing engine oil drive car decent amount time like minute moisture evaporate continue see foamy mixture though would indicate coolant mixing engine oil usually via failing head gasket

hi im looking advice go shop either buy service get estimate sound like idea im talking need service ac gettin ready brutal phoenix summer say want service ac need ac tuned want get reamed thanks
tell want make sure ac working summer hit make sure enough refrigerant system ac compressor working
best advice find local private shop trust blown away estimate see people getting franchise dealer near
something wrong ac blowing cold enough would say dont even bring unless problem isnt much term service unless problem
thing fine ask assuming ac isnt working expect pay flat fee service plus refrigerant actually diagnostic check see whats broken system doesnt work something broken somewhere get pretty expensive maybe leak bad compressor almost anything service working ac estimate repair sometimes extra diag time necessary able choose go forward smart time live northern hemisphere busy word mouth one best way find shop trust
contact shop service let know want done scheduled maintenance based time mileage case ac let know symptom noticing let know want estimate actually repair service make sure know get contact leave one option dont worry knowing much car unless went school nobody would really expect

oil filter little spur end tiny oring fit little hole easily damaged installation tech installing filter didnt insert right way torqued filter cap back may bent broken entirely causing blockage allow oil flow filter shouldnt let leave service center oil pressure light least experienced technician taken filter check see seated properly one time entire chain employee technician manager failed job sorry happened
low oil pressure warning stop immediately check oil level didnt see mention basic stuff essential also check see oil leaking around oil filter housing happen oil filter gasket isnt installed right oil light go immediately engine start way drive hour warm
wtf cold oil give higher pressure lower
insurance decide car certainly request work done dealer youll even lucky get engine isnt pulled junkyard
bah cheap oil ruining engine decade quater state another one
wouldnt let choose take vehicle towed dealership
since didnt get oil level warning would assume changed oil filter forget refill oil center part housing left stuck old filter unclip cover httpspreviewredditqxvwjhlssejpegwidthformatpjpgautowebpscfccaacecbcaeecbfedaf without center part nearly oil pressure drain back sump immediately
cold maybe oil tractor nah fed
cold oil california wtf mean sound like tryin throw shit wall see stick
euro car take specifically euro style oil unfortunately see lot shop paper say plat full synth euro ask manager ordered usually end full synth sae work use happens lot may happened see test oil possibly see put shop also think everything take dumped sae oil thick oil passage bearing journal cause oil pressure light come since isnt moving oil channel also manager think treat bmw like shit put sae full synth doesnt mean customer bmws asshat
doubt oil grade going cause problem short term likely oil filter installed correctly incorrect oil filter installed bmw oil filter include integrated feature like bypass valve antidrain back valve sealing component tuned bmw spec valvoline issue garage responsible
definitely didnt put oil lmao
valvoline always hire people know absolutely nothing car regular basis never take em one

basically correct would switch engine engine designed specific compression ratio compatible certain octane level also correct would cheaper get appropriate vehicle start explains dont hear anyone
modern car detect detonationpreignition pull timing much possible designed entire life temporarily yes absolutely
say premium recommended look actual octane required see regular actually allowed octane actually required modification engine required
get cheapest tesla save alot
car exactly modern car simply retard timing automatically wont notice difference normal driving condition youll lose power wot there little practical drawback older car distributor type ignition high end performance car exception
brand car aftermarket tuning capability might able retune ecm lower power level would allow lower grade fuel engine would significantly less power
colorado zr mile cyl start right check engine light rpm temp gauge great rough idle starting idling also possibly slightly rough ride spark plug changed throttle body cleaned mechanic month ago idea would really appreciated thank advance

kia forte aftermarket led headlight unfortunately led insanely bright awesome think frustrating everyone else lol solution ive heard lot getting readjusted wondering effective maybe trying tint would something like tint could find whether thatd good idea well expect pay went route id probably tint headlight taillight turn signal daytime running light anyone ballpark guess much thatd id appreciate
tinting headlight help reduce brightness glare however critical check local legislation certain area prohibit changing vehicle light tinting film price vary quality brand full set headlight taillight turn signal daytime running light could cost depending type film whether use professional installer ensure alteration conform local road safety law adjusting headlight aim may also help reduce glare maintaining appearance
took camry dealership regular oil change tire rotation said small oil leak bring back month check seen oil driveway oil light come returning month later checked dipstick still full top line nd check said quart small leak timing cover valve cover gasket drive great long commute ive always taken regularly mile hoping get mile trading plus interest rate high thought option getting fixed basically said could wait get full engine replaced trade
keep checking oil adding needed small leak shouldnt much problem reason new engine unless oil blowing piston ring
ignore opinion guess there combination minor oil leak burning little oil none justifies tearing apart year old car mile worth little keep eye would also suggest using overly thin oil u company recommend hit mileage target something like usually better burning less oil leak there also high mileage oil seal conditioning additive
leak big deal make sure timing belt isnt overdue there usually mileage written timing cover

ciao tutti vi pongo una domanda che ho testa da un po credo che purtroppo non ci sia una risposta chiara davvero pi sostenibile sostituire unauto combustione funzionante con una nuova elettrica oppure sarebbe meglio mantenerla pi lungo per ridurre la produzione complessiva di veicoli mi spiego meglio da un lato lauto elettrica zero emissioni dirette sembrerebbe la scelta pi ecologicadallaltro la produzione di un nuovo veicolo elettrico comporta emissioni importanti soprattutto per batterie materie prime rottamare unauto ancora funzionante non proprio il massimo ottica di economia circolare inoltre quanto pesa davvero il ciclo produttivo di unauto elettrica estrazione produzione smaltimento tenere unauto termica pi lungo pu avere senso ecologico se si guida poco zone senza alternative quanto conta lefficienza dellintero sistema ricarica da rinnovabili uso condiviso urbanistica qual il vostro punto di vista grazie
ciao domanda super interessante generale sostituire unauto combustione funzionante con unelettrica nuova non sempre la scelta pi sostenibile soprattutto se lauto attuale buone condizioni viene usata poco la produzione di unauto elettrica soprattutto della batteria comporta unimpronta ambientale iniziale significativa legata allestrazione di litio cobalto ecc ai processi industriali tuttavia nel lungo periodo dopo circa km secondo diversi studi unauto elettrica pu compensare quelle emissioni grazie alle minori emissioni fase duso soprattutto se ricaricata con energia rinnovabile quindi il contesto conta tantissimo se si vive una zona con elettricit da fonti rinnovabili molte colonnine si percorrono parecchi km lanno lelettrico ha senso anche ambientalmente se invece si guida poco magari un contesto dove non ci sono grandi alternative di mobilit continuare usare lauto esistente pu essere pi sostenibile che rottamarla presto per un nuovo veicolo ottica di vera sostenibilit il top sarebbe ridurre luso dellauto generale puntare su mobilit dolce mezzi pubblici condivisione dei veicoli ovviamente dipende anche da quanto il contesto urbano infrastrutturale lo permette insomma pi che una risposta secca una questione di equilibri priorit ottimo che se ne parli che si facciano dei distinguo invece di schierarsi tra il demonizzare le auto elettriche magnificarle

hello honda accord mile always get different type oil want know whats best car
accord ex us written fillcap ive always felt bad oil old oil change onschedule rest car wear engine said favor fullsynthetic purolator bos fram ultra filter
manufacturer buy company anyway
use oem car warranty otherwise get wix xp
there ton info various forum filter better oil oil company change formula every couple year forum full debatehttpsbobistheoilguycomforums
dont use fram sometimes oem bad fram use kn wrench filter use solid oem design add useful hex head use idiot cranked calling hand tight xd
short answer depends long answer car manufacture dont make filter oil theyre going cut deal company theyre going pick whatever fit need budget whatever pick rebranded sometimes pick good stuff sometimes pick crap example gm cut deal stp filter castrol oil get gm branded filter oil factory dealer exactly stp filter castrol oil get autozone buying brand buying oem sometimes better get fram filter sometimes worse get kn filter oil economics also different dealer autozone oem filteroil may cheaper stpcastrol counterpart even though thing idk gm us filter oil picked name example idk kn better worse fram stp example
wix thats need know
aside fram good castrol big sponsor old toyota race car thats toyota get
specific vehicle used mobil oil oil filter along purolator pure one oil filter issue ever change oil every month
oil need match specified api rating aftermarket oil filter ive generally read wix go
removed
car company often use brand oem least used one car owned used motul oem oil thats recomended manufacturer smaller manufacturer like ferrari also use branded oil im pretty sure
used use oem switched best reviewed filter change oil often keep using stp autozone keep giving free anyone buy quart oil
engine designed tested oem oil different oil different performance characteristic maybe thing better worse there way know without extensive testing sort basically nobody time budget way answer question engine perform designed oem oil likely oil maybe get close matter maybe tradeoff worth maybe difference detectable customer there way know advance making decision

get second opinion take dealer let check see he right go
filled oil fault there way tell oil pump going fail inspection item unless disassembling engine dad sure w filled oil mechanic didnt forget
possible cause really cold put high viscosity oil eg oil pump may able pull oil especially oil pump seems far fetched ask dealership check oil heck could put transmission fluid check make sure filter right one said brought back could discovered problem like covered mistake without telling
maybe checking oil pressure gage maybe something electrical upset arriving code low oil pressure light reading rumble could rumble suddenly sensitive sound
know said toyota phow many mile yeah oil full sound like bad timingbad luck many people looking find reason like last thing ex got gas yesterday car wont start think got bad gas see constantly

didnt state many mile
ran car mistake adding oil could damaged engine fault code would shown cleared may check control message history depending car dealer one look time stamp fault possible check control message see anythings ordinary
long wait oil change curious waited long time bunch sludge got loose end new oil clog pump
change oil every mile oil pump still go nissan kia hyundai
im sorry
said oil level fine therefore fault oil change drain change filter fill leak nothing caused absolutely way could predicted oil pump bad without issue thump related engine issue id definitely towed another shop get second opinion
imo seems mechanical failure either fix scrap really one blame car machine worn doesnt care rich poor reached end mechanical life need either repaired replaced oil change magical fix failing engine
likely coincidence oil change fresh oil weak pump oil pumpengine failed shop work car want car die want keep running thus theyd make money get second opinion repair
brake ripoff oil sending unit go back burn shop ive entire engine replaced less find another mechanic send first guy invoice
im thinking road tested thumping issue oil engine drained oil change forgot refill got back test drive realized mistake added oil way late didnt tell
ehh there slim chance put wrong weight oil even likely wouldnt cause oil pump smoke another thing could oil filter could wrong filter even though fit thread trying pump plugged bypass hence oil pressure reason oil changesamount everything else see oil come youre suspicious send sample analyzed predict wear virtually one small engine past thump wheel bearing ball joint likely something area jack pry different direction tire look whats moving front end excessively
unlikely cause shop changing oil move stuff around oil pump probably last leg already
yeah guy trying take advantage price high find someone like mobile mechanic come install part putting oil pump isnt crazy really thing would pulling main cap rod cap checking bearing id drained oil saved pull oil pan see crud inside oil pan pulling cap oil pump isnt anything crazy
oil pump way id imagine could clogged crud pickup screen

sure already know check oil always pull dipstick wipe put back pull check pull check straight away oil dipstick tube splashing around want check clean dipstick possible oil pump way oil change removed sludge holding stuff together many mile
find exact oil filter used make sure compatible car friend got filter autozone correct valve internal component ended causing major noise due oil circulating hyundai tucson required new engine extended warranty swapped right filter towed shop
checking oil wish people understood one side dipstick show oil thr dipstick submerged oil lowest point dipstick oil level
make real glad fix stuff getting ripped repair im sure go replacing oil pump engine im familiar also wouldnt think changing oil could done anything may weird coincidence decided go time blew oil maybe
definitely steep internal oil pump could referring timing belt belt snapped bent rod there warning sign snap negligence
first suspect would oil filter maybe something blocking oil going sometimes engine gone long without maintenance oil changed bearing crankshaft turn block oil pressure
wonder something fell engine oil change debris clogged oil pick oil pan thats start oil pressure issue
took meticulous care toyota pretty unlikely motor bricked im sure couldve ruined either though take wasnt making noise shopthat day
see type car shop time time complete shitbox rusted bolt away junkyard multiple problem car neglected year yet always mechanic fault something go shit bad oil change rear head immediately day unless pissing oil parking lot get negligence happen responsibility keep car bad sealing washer oil filter gasket happen even best mechanic earth ultimately make sure car leaking anything let stop blaming shop thing adult take care

im hd truck mechanic dont set preloaded right thing happen st tight spindle melt bearing nd loose ypu lb hub tandem tire bouncing road mph use torque wrench use correct backoff spec axle working
absolutely despise ive wrong year nothing gone wrong mentality engineer saw spec torque figure one shall torque accordingly
work semi truck legality wise something happens
yep liability thing
torque spec every single wheel end component ive ever worked multiple reason smarter people designed specific way set specific torque value preload procedure ive seen happens dont people die help dont second guess worry go road note say torqued manufacture spec followed proper procedure liability get argue point still league better dont need fancy torque wrench tell job edit also worth noting im medheavy duty still point stand
depends axle type generally speaking yes get torque wrench time preloading bearing important get proper spec feel torque
axle nut spindle tie rod spindle nut always come back free labor improper torque could cause undue stress neighbor component
yes question
asking important questionand making possible decision habit stick rest life right torque
every time primarily due fact suv torque spec ft lb small coupe call im looking porsche realistically try use one every bolt nut removed besides body panel accessory mounting course
every time follow procedure professional thing
always zip didnt issue year
axle nut cv axle everytime wheel nut tire impact ive used yr isnt used know setting
subarus zip dent meet indent like came never issue majority time engineer engineering
ill admit year never put torque wrench cv axle nut
use torque wrench every time zip impact lot time still always check torque spec first something like ftlbs back turn ftlbs plus degree ill actually go effort thread hand tool say flat number like ftlbs ill give bean impact check torque wrench least never issue yet also tip one need angle meter use marker mark line either nut socket start point use estimate degree wont exact itll close enough
definitely torque every time isnt difficult important life bearing safety customer vw us torque yield bolt axle torque spec others range ft lb say never problem ignorant understand axle nut ball joint ect month ago customer back needing wheel bearing likely could avoided proper torque
almost job would certainly use torque wrench needle kind
ugga duggad first one put car lasted day mile work started making bearing noise lifted work wheel like httpsyoutubecomshortsutrekxfc except cadillac deville mall crawler yeah hub nut get torque wrench every time
much pressure put stress wheel bearing flat frankly entire wheel bolt need torqued axle nut lol
honestly think find ive year mentally come simple fact year year ago internet small non dealer workshop dont procedure torque spec laid follow book vehicle head gasket torque didnt come gasket kit big end main bearing also phone call machine shop bearing packet maybe got lucky bos repair manual specific car information easily accessible everything done without dealership procedure torque
wouldnt use torque wrench
torque wrench piece mind safety someone elses
really believe tightening lug nutsbolts drain plug spark plug everything else correctly without using torque wrench lying
gun pretty hard always double check
torqued every axle nut wheel spec every car ever worked ive auto mechanic since absolutely hate comeback
torqueing trash panda move need preload right prevent excessive hub playrunout keep bearing failing early
torque nut preload swapped one yesterday went bad lose wore recently done bearing torque spec everything especially wheel followed zip course dont expect last
call torqued torque take couple minute right
youll burn wheel bearing best cause death worst dont set correctly experience
torque yield bolt euro friction washer underneath
ive year classic survivorship bias people go wrong arent around tell story take extra minute torque spec
old day would matter flimsy construction new car lightweight look way screw
question doesnt

hey bought used ford mile bought mechanic inspect truck said fantastic condition put mile without problem mile started problem truck struggle start warm start currently mile always start cold start engine would also occasionally stall driving interstate took mechanic said fuel module culprit replaced stopped stalling interstate still struggled start warm start wouldnt start took different mechanic friend mine said fuel module first mechanic put poor quality replaced ford manufactured one replaced fuel pump suspected fuel supply issue fix problem friend suggested take ford dealership looked get diagnostic done electrical system could find anything wrong diagnostic tried emulate problem able point im desperate solution still money loan mechanical issue truck worth less owe loan help would appreciated
careful op internet expert may sound certain online diagnosis still guessing like previous mechanic real technician make easy work isolating correcting problem suggest find shop ase certified technicianhttpsasecomdrivers diagnose vehicle problem hard could people guess fuel pump based symptom rather data diagnostics even though one mechanic already tried solution mechanic suspect fuel pressure problem occurs warm start cold start wouldnt fuel pressure gauge good tool use similarly someone check see motor ignition system delivering healthy spark warm start part replaced please people stop guessing
tried spark plug fuel filter
anyone actually checked fuel pressure verified regulator working properly regulator also leak suck fuel vacuum line would also verify actual engine temp matching coolant temp sensor ive seen coolant temp reading degree degree ambient engine trying add fuel cold start doesnt need would also verify maf working properly
check vacuum leak
yes think fuel pump work cold start warmed didnt replace fuel filter pump bad move cheap pump go month later thats want spend part one thing pump go normal weather another happen winter sometimes there wiring fuel pump problem ground fry mainly buying cheap replacement also filter
im thinking fuel pump act warm next time tap tank rubber mallet start know pump
sound like clogged catalytic converter could also ignition coil tho really easy thing diagnose anybody without spending time truck least might get direction
fuel treatment really important people family saying waste money google search doesnt really answer question theyre super important difference super cheap one expensive one tia
ill toss bottle every couple year case got water somewhere modern refining storage process pretty sold letting water wasnt always
aaa ran study top tier gas worth read httpswwwaceaaacomautomotiveadvocacytoptiergasolinehtml
largely waste money use namebrand big gas gasoline since detergent additive mixed fuel buy shitty convenience store gasoline youll occasionally need bottle additive maintain clear fuel injector spray pattern injector interrupted fuel deposit fuel economy performance start suffer fuel system problem may require advanced treatment injector replacement
add bottle fuel injection cleaner tank every oil change additive snake oil
need top tier gas google
back u federal trade commission actually worked public good sued manufacturer couple brand treatment product nonproprietary mixture common solvent couldnt prove anything remove claim specific horsepower fuel economy increase making may apply brand youve ever seen harsh solvent gasoline hard believe anything theyre willing make specific claim method cleaning fuel system one thing proven work feeding naphthabased cleaner like seafoam directly engine via intake manifold diluted fuel auto manufacturer produced version product calling top end cleaner combustion chamber cleaner clean carbon deposit valve cylinder head piston however riskfree dropin thing dump much damage catalytic converter stall engine make horrific cloud smoke
there enough detergent gas major station dont really need anymore youre getting cheapo gas name station middle nowhere regularly maybe youd exception
others said think top tier gas pretty much job know honda officially recommends annual techron cleaner tank something heck bona fide product around long time
fuel come location regionally top tier fuel better detergentsadditives mixed fwiw certification requires payment labeled top tier fuel
subaru seems recommend one pea
ive yet see proof benefit
dont need one unless actually issue really diesel user freezing weather may use something bc fuel gells gas nope stick top tier quality fuel like shell
put redline fuel system cleaner gas tank near empty filled tank drove mile feel like brand new car stuff work restored lost power improved fuel economy make engine run quieter
worth money keeping injector fuel system clean definitely useful diesel city driving rather long journey clog less
depends vehicle
hello preface yesterday check engine check battery light yesterday driving highway car started lose electrical power pull side road prior issue acceleration today went replaced alternator check battery light longer car seems issue regarding electricity longer accelerate step gas issue turning rolling idling car also shift gear still move minimum speed drive reverse anyone solid guess likely causing
sound like alternator replacement fixed electrical issue there something else going since idling fine wont accelerate id check throttle position sensor tps vacuum leak cause sluggish throttle response could also fuel delivery issue pump filter obd scanner see new code popped alternator swap chance battery disconnected repair sometimes reset ecu cause weird behavior relearns

chain company independent
check plug see loose slow leak doesnt necessarily mean plug isnt tight secure anything probably torqued youll find damage take plug fix possible reinstalled plug without washer new washer needed torqued point damage andor cross threated stripped thread oil pan next possible fix would drill hole install new thread pan replace drain plug kit last fix would replace oil pan depending bad may different fix varying cost
oil drain plug dont fall unless something seriously wrong could crush gasket bad isnt something indeed wrong thread would recommend putting silicon around plug change pan
still leaking safe may need new washer next oil change

recommendation kind big cleaning engine flush thing cause problem dirty engine instead oil change every mile awhile good name brand oil synthetic better cleaning adding mess thatll clean gradually risk gunking everything junk dissolving oil stronger cleaning method cleaned go mile thats generally recommend topping damage questionif tore engine youd probably find gunk varnish everywhere maybe scratch groove cam rod main bearing surface maybe wear cam lobe also negatively impact piston ring short term bigger probably bearing wear low compression oil burn bad ring impact car much quickly edit trans thats much closed system still need changed break doesnt fuel combustion product getting dropped like engine oil probably fine automatic transmission fluid maybe mile refresh since method remove half old stuff get stuck torque converter coolerlines etc
saab engine kind sensitive plus older car overall make sure keep oil changed regularly saabs
changed oil mi good insurance oil doesnt cost much
could send oil sample blackstone youre worried damage
already lasted id say youre pretty well see youre already getting truly insane advice mile youre really worried get tested said test tell metal content oil among thing know bearing failing there option test check much oil consumables left like detergent anticoagulant kind thing help judge long go change even reasonable really want shorten service dont something insane like edit made clear blackstone lab test give decent summary condition spreadsheet number look well worth whatever dollar youre u losing fortune shipping surely option location well including usa
mile oil change thats insane manufacturer specification new engine good condition engine wear need frequent oil change depending driving habit would oil change every mile even less
oil oil filter change insane around half ideal ask every overkill drive car hard still good idea would personally never go personally every two cent also air filter need done every kk mile make gas mileage less easily changed enough

probably easier swap fuel door frame signature first thought apply clear coat solvent might dissolve ink
rthedollop
maybe put ppf
get professional photo frame clean car
httpswwwamazoncomdpbbixsma
another guy said get photo taken frame however said wash disagree think probably get clear sealant extend life biggest thing concerned uv damagefading
spray clear coat layer good
ask vinyl manufacturer piece clear scrap transparent vinyl could probably ask apply
laminate
would either get replacement gas cap really want keep car use clear coat paint
gary gary gary
uv resistant clear coat
least one subreddit car detailing id ask
maybe try rautobody there lot knowledgeable people
obviously take good picture first mess recreate
carpartcom grab another fuel door junk yard swap
remove door put inside shadow box buy new door car
acrylic garage floor paint
sharpie great sticking nonporous surface suck lightfastness unless car garaged day week autograph brown two week invisible might last six month uv clear coat frame high quality photo get replacement fuel door frame one
replace many factor weather related fuck tbh
signed girlfriend fuel door thats best euphemism ive ever heard
small piece ppf
dust clear lacquer
make sure doesnt spread sharpie around
ask rautobody might recommendation
place clear tape seal edge tape clear nail polish dry seal whole thing wont bleed signature
sun fade sharpie within week ive written drum label sharpie come back month later label blank like never wrote anything agree others swap fuel door want keep trace signature paint pen last alot longer
ppf paint protection film
get someone laser etch anything know wont disappear
clear automotive vinyl would probably work perfectly
signing car
drew dick back mate car sharpie year sold mildly faded always
knew comedian title lol folk unaware check dollop podcast gareths stand special
clear contact paper dollar tree sell cut big outside wrap around inside margin dont leak
dont try sharpie clear coat together inconspicuous spot see react
clear paint protection film tint shop sell small piece probably install fuel door
seems like great idea today get canceled metooed something swap fuel door
matter way go think scuff surface apply anything yeah best way replace gas cap sharpy lift dissolve alcohol
paint protection film would probably work easy mostly flat surface like gas cap
could try clear plasti dip leaf rubber coating would removable need
would ask local body shop probably type clear coat also signature mean lot maybe get another fuel door swap could keep original indoors even sealed might fade sun
dont use film fade ink acidic glue degrades ink
make sure replacement fuel door painted funny color
paint protective film
could get clear wrap
sun sharpie marker fade sunlight month year indoors permanent wont come ultraviolet light break ink time indoors keep direct sunlight mark rothko painting executive office faded due sunlight replace keep indoors shadowbox display perhaps paint clearcoat uv protectant good automotive painter go automotive lacquer test painting marker similar surface first though
get new fuel door swap keepsake
clear car spray paint find walmart usually used help prevent uv damage
ppf
took ford cmax mile service mechanic took garage showed foam oil cap explained head gasket might failing said there oil coolant visual inspection cant say certain head gasket failure keep close eye overheats bring immediately question sure head gasket issue car ticking time bomb suddenly car get repaired price quoted reasonable failing mile better getting new car trade value dont want pour money drain car
foam could due condensation take lot short trip hybrid vehicle engine oil doesnt get hot enough turn moisture steam oil look like look like milkshake problem keep eye coolant level note often need add beware coolant level different depending whether engine hot cold take look manual info need keep adding coolant may burning combustion case keep driving long make sure keep coolant topped continue check oil ever look like milkshake need stop driving damage engine car burning coolant possible remain way car ever overheats condition get worse get oil betting condensation especially hybrid car mostly drive using electricity good luck
yes maybe short trip clean take long run check next day
dont want necessarily jump conclusion sound like shitty mechanic trying get pay money repair dont truly need immediately suggest bad head gasket due foam oil cap really irresponsible actually far common people realize live wet cold snowy area take lot short trip unless car overheating coolant oil mixing smoke coming tailpipe wouldnt worry
milky white lot short drive could condensation build didnt burn engine get hot enough could also bad pcv would replace first anything else also leak test commit full head gasket job
short trip modern car dont temperature gauge easier older car tell blown gasket usually needle would run low got traffic would climb rather maintaining constant temperature guage
also losing coolant

yes thermostat could malfunctioning keep engine temperature steady around degree dropping low degree could indicate thermostat stuck open causing engine run cool might lead inefficient fuel usage potential damage time thermostat changed
definitely sound like thermostat issue probably stuck open engine isnt holding temp higher speed failing thermostat hurt fuel efficiency time cause extra wear since engine isnt warming properly might want get replaced soon especially winter youre colder climate noticed symptom like poor heater performance hope help

ill toss bottle every couple year case got water somewhere modern refining storage process pretty sold letting water wasnt always
aaa ran study top tier gas worth read httpswwwaceaaacomautomotiveadvocacytoptiergasolinehtml
largely waste money use namebrand big gas gasoline since detergent additive mixed fuel buy shitty convenience store gasoline youll occasionally need bottle additive maintain clear fuel injector spray pattern injector interrupted fuel deposit fuel economy performance start suffer fuel system problem may require advanced treatment injector replacement
add bottle fuel injection cleaner tank every oil change additive snake oil
need top tier gas google
back u federal trade commission actually worked public good sued manufacturer couple brand treatment product nonproprietary mixture common solvent couldnt prove anything remove claim specific horsepower fuel economy increase making may apply brand youve ever seen harsh solvent gasoline hard believe anything theyre willing make specific claim method cleaning fuel system one thing proven work feeding naphthabased cleaner like seafoam directly engine via intake manifold diluted fuel auto manufacturer produced version product calling top end cleaner combustion chamber cleaner clean carbon deposit valve cylinder head piston however riskfree dropin thing dump much damage catalytic converter stall engine make horrific cloud smoke
there enough detergent gas major station dont really need anymore youre getting cheapo gas name station middle nowhere regularly maybe youd exception
others said think top tier gas pretty much job know honda officially recommends annual techron cleaner tank something heck bona fide product around long time
fuel come location regionally top tier fuel better detergentsadditives mixed fwiw certification requires payment labeled top tier fuel
subaru seems recommend one pea
ive yet see proof benefit
dont need one unless actually issue really diesel user freezing weather may use something bc fuel gells gas nope stick top tier quality fuel like shell
put redline fuel system cleaner gas tank near empty filled tank drove mile feel like brand new car stuff work restored lost power improved fuel economy make engine run quieter

hey people circle always talk bmws hella unreliable break often im sure true guy positivenegative experience car
maintenance expensive necessary bmw car last there old saying car expensive new luxury car used luxury car basically cost arm leg something break warranty previous owner used bmw attest
owner worked mechanic service manager theyre unreliable dont keep maintenance oil change coolant flush like everything theyre expensive maintain remember replace oil pan bmw cost much used car grand problem people buy without money maintain get rid maintenance cost add
straight six model model pretty reliable problem maintenance expensive people often push catastrophic failure cost value vehicle
like car good bad older car issue owned highly praised engine blow month ownership car low mile owner well taken care original anything happen
arent ive found thing personal experience first build quality isnt good mine sort big little really unacceptable flaw shouldnt second dealer servicing isnt really goodand incredibly expensive lastly many people beat crap add get car poor rep would never buy used one even cpo cross town rival mb
cant say model coupe nonm reliable car ive ever owned crossed odometer ive never breakdown mechanical issue outside typical high mileage failure like starter dying straight engine extremely reliable even tempered fairly minimal far electronics go since almost year old point isnt really lot fail blast drive still get comment everywhere go gorgeous car actually made coupe nonm variant make even rare mcoupe im sad bmw developed new tandem toyota supra mean likely ever coupe since part deal toyota get coupe bmw get convertible
dont bmw tow truck driver told hauled car
like car unreliable people taking care course odd bad apple bmws high mileage current mi km mine
strut bushing need word every car company
ive owned almost year unreliable keeping properly maintained key want perform intended weakness addressed become expensive repair bmw owned tho experience limited
engine catastrophic engine issue require avoiding cost bigger issue seems use plastic component real stupid area related cooling ive looked used bmws recently dripping coolant somewhere
ive always found funny motorcycle opposite reputation least used
petrol extremely unreliable family owns dealership multiple issue booked one bmw told dont repair instead full engine replacement front back diesel bmws though reliable option
owned series arent expensive willing able work buy part online good thing relatively easy work especially one straight there quite bit room long engine bay bad thing lot sensor car seem go bad time
terrible car leased one brand new get towed twice would never get one
myth properly maintained fine although maintenance expensive
ive never issue understand plastic get brittle break address issue happen meaning follow maintenance schedule youll fine
people need learn
ive convertible since new year two thing went wrong within mile never go wrong new oil filter housing gasket new water pump know issue happen car bmw didnt anything neither covered based time mile ended getting back water pump due class action lawsuit sure wasnt lawsuit ofhg well wasnt towed least ive acuras lexus never towed love car reliable according consumer report newer one better bought new bmw convertible also repair expensive
theyre better used theyre best choice german luxury brand still nothing compared toyota honda part expensive labour often specialized
older bmw bought last year mechanical work far car reliable pretty easy service however couldnt give one later model theyre overengineered point ridiculousness whole purpose seems force owner back dealership everything oil dipstick wtf
arent say many pretty creaky day hard plastic especially black line trim
dont let sit idle extended period rescued series convertible apartment complex corpus christi sitting year ran upon jumping replace brake suspension im still hunting check engine light code
maintenance honda thats sure drive better honda
might lucky mile reliable minor issue outside normal maintainance full service history one previous owner though never problem left stranded anything like cant speak dealer price maintainance surprisingly easy work part mostly expensive normal car
ive owned used never anything would consider maintenancewear tear first left stranded water pump failure free aaa tow home weekend part running time said ive owned vehicle chevy hondas etc left stranded atleast stay away model based good straight engine solid specifically engine
ive series since ive replace tire far im diligent following maintenance schedule maybe thats hope get like
certain engine unreliable usn euro disaster timing chain basically disintegrated time leading catastrophic failure kind unreliable nothing crazy basic leak need fixed bseries truly one greatest engine ever made tank also phenomenal theyre objectively unreliable bmw would qualify hondatoyotalike engine europe theyre super logically assembled easy take apart awesome service manual stay top maintenance youre gucci
ive got couple neighbour look relatively reliable vehicle
bseries generally good engine designed together toyota least extremely solid engine hp zf automatic gearbox pretty much reliable best market outside quite lot golden pick id call need knowledge avoid look every single good option one big point need considered make engine good maintenance good maintenance make engine last good engine good paired good maintenance youll need look point failure generally always odd ball car shit factory assembly line effed nothing also bought used never know previous owner maintained drove maintenance perfect start car instantly give full throttle pushing right red line cold engine expect last forever performance car delusional car dead time short reliable user want
dad started lot issue like oil burning catalitic converter leaking radiator fan spinning max speed constantly even multiple trip garage etc replaced hasnt issue leaking headlight boring low power engine non car people regularly serviced dealer cant speak sportier car
son used work bmw dealership said people would come service department bragging awesome deal got used bmw upon inspection car needed thousand dollar repair buyer found hard way wasnt great deal said couple people simply abandoned car dealership
compared car owned far away expensive repair part labor ridiculous im high mileage driver afraid making paying repair car sucked much money
meh cost come fact many component fail old fiat used simple engine got okay mile gallon enough torque move around town bmw similar mpgs enough torque make smile come price though price paid maintenance
really depends model engine gen pretty bulletproof modern mi
owned two bmws low mile think theyre overrated po car road nothing super expensive problem car would
drive daily tolerant neglect something break costly repair unless replace couple thing overall great car engine problematic driven abusively cent
notoriously unreliable mile plenty go id say
never anything go wrong year competition new bmws proving reliable especially straight
nearly km got free year ownership maintenance repair buck im process replacing original alternator right honestly minute job refurbished part quarter price bmw wrecker everything need day automatic transmission number failed reverse gear one need replacing well seems weak point particular vintage looking manual swap funsies previous owner complete hack tho electrical repair something ive lot overall one pretty solid platform wouldnt want paying shop rate genuine part price fix
arent unreliable totally reliable problem talking maintenance repair cost think race car need engine rebuilt every race tire get changed many time single day performance bmw performance kind use lose scenario step corner stress bushing tire etc fun lot people think worth cost lot maintain quality part wear faster cheapoecono part doesnt mean race car bad actually really good part get worn job perform
racked mile sold regret day reliable car next vw bug fun car drive next porsche well built machine high maintenance
maintenance expensive people dont get shit fixed car sold used people dont know shit car theyre getting buy shit finally break neglect get slapped huge bill naive as go dealership repair people vocal basically unless youre mechanically inclined know youre getting people lease buy new covered warranty people stupid stretch something cant afford impress others theyll cut corner get even mean buying used one without repair history take gamble often doesnt work favor
owned couple bmw product mini cooper series cannot begin explain choose gasketseal material last compared lexussubarutoyota experience service life bmw gasket material japanese equivalent
ive heard explained longtime bmw motorcycle mechanic bmws designed assumption person building meticulous precise owner similarly meticulous maintenance shop mechanic break design doesnt like thing tolerance
bmws great kmmi need everything replaceable replaced great another need done little thing need done seems typical experience youre buying new awesome youre buying warranty theyre ok buying year old car km going reliable one km
consider maintenance owning brand vehicle
needy comparison japanese car give percent performance repair
mi hasnt issue breakdown regular maintenance item
found depends model pretty trouble free reliable aside big scheduled maintenance mile crazy maintenance said thing break get wallet need brake everything expensive fix replace model absolute fucking nightmare research buying realistic whether afford maintenance
buddy owned bmws said would never buy one many repair issue expensive maintain keep leasing new one every year great
good car high maintenance also hi tech engineering lot turbos etc toyota would personally drive new wasnt mechanically inclined
sit reading typing xi wait windshield thaw say nothing good sure there little thing honestly worst oil leak min fix oil change regular time work alows one set brake last little rust front fender much live rust belt drive thing year round absolute shit weather
people always say maintain surely thats bad mean replaced part becomes problem still replaced part
many variable dumb reliable notoriously awful taken care ive two newer bmws currently needed stuff take par dead reliable two year ive right thats actually notoriously shitty motor ive load pre car absolutely turd nice reliable one people generally bitching maintenance cost second third owner wondering car higher level engineering failing dont change oil every ignore oil coolant leak
reliable cost arm leg maintain
non turbo model best far reliability note however car loaded electronics sensor prone either brief glitch making small problem apparent patience troubleshoot minor problem youll save service visit nice drive car
like car visit dealer per year oil change new year later
base model speed straight door sedan guy bought apparently second owner sure believe told couldnt sell going turn drift missile scrap kinda knew buying car rough life likely abused often ive owned year averaging year keep running inspected doesnt include gas insurance tyre thats maintenance garage cost dont skill tool space moment time maintenance cost would half ive done thing like oil change brake coolant bit spark plug im mechanic everytime drive like game make destination something break day year actually work one best car ive driven fastest handle really good sound ok feel new car dont ill never buy another bmw also dont plan getting rid one
expensive repair maintenance cost ive owned euro car followed english car crater bank account
cant find good car shipping company actual good review without crazy incident car
used montway much shorter trip great best price driver communicated great actually day early
ok started last year bad mass airflow sensor changed car started running phenomenally however stop car stall press gas go changed sensor throttle position sensor still way keep going keep foot brake pedal give gas going even isnt super reliable idea

straight six model model pretty reliable problem maintenance expensive people often push catastrophic failure cost value vehicle
like car good bad older car issue owned highly praised engine blow month ownership car low mile owner well taken care original anything happen
arent ive found thing personal experience first build quality isnt good mine sort big little really unacceptable flaw shouldnt second dealer servicing isnt really goodand incredibly expensive lastly many people beat crap add get car poor rep would never buy used one even cpo cross town rival mb
cant say model coupe nonm reliable car ive ever owned crossed odometer ive never breakdown mechanical issue outside typical high mileage failure like starter dying straight engine extremely reliable even tempered fairly minimal far electronics go since almost year old point isnt really lot fail blast drive still get comment everywhere go gorgeous car actually made coupe nonm variant make even rare mcoupe im sad bmw developed new tandem toyota supra mean likely ever coupe since part deal toyota get coupe bmw get convertible

theyre better used theyre best choice german luxury brand still nothing compared toyota honda part expensive labour often specialized
older bmw bought last year mechanical work far car reliable pretty easy service however couldnt give one later model theyre overengineered point ridiculousness whole purpose seems force owner back dealership everything oil dipstick wtf
arent say many pretty creaky day hard plastic especially black line trim
dont let sit idle extended period rescued series convertible apartment complex corpus christi sitting year ran upon jumping replace brake suspension im still hunting check engine light code
maintenance honda thats sure drive better honda
might lucky mile reliable minor issue outside normal maintainance full service history one previous owner though never problem left stranded anything like cant speak dealer price maintainance surprisingly easy work part mostly expensive normal car
ive owned used never anything would consider maintenancewear tear first left stranded water pump failure free aaa tow home weekend part running time said ive owned vehicle chevy hondas etc left stranded atleast stay away model based good straight engine solid specifically engine
ive series since ive replace tire far im diligent following maintenance schedule maybe thats hope get like
certain engine unreliable usn euro disaster timing chain basically disintegrated time leading catastrophic failure kind unreliable nothing crazy basic leak need fixed bseries truly one greatest engine ever made tank also phenomenal theyre objectively unreliable bmw would qualify hondatoyotalike engine europe theyre super logically assembled easy take apart awesome service manual stay top maintenance youre gucci
ive got couple neighbour look relatively reliable vehicle

never anything go wrong year competition new bmws proving reliable especially straight
nearly km got free year ownership maintenance repair buck im process replacing original alternator right honestly minute job refurbished part quarter price bmw wrecker everything need day automatic transmission number failed reverse gear one need replacing well seems weak point particular vintage looking manual swap funsies previous owner complete hack tho electrical repair something ive lot overall one pretty solid platform wouldnt want paying shop rate genuine part price fix
arent unreliable totally reliable problem talking maintenance repair cost think race car need engine rebuilt every race tire get changed many time single day performance bmw performance kind use lose scenario step corner stress bushing tire etc fun lot people think worth cost lot maintain quality part wear faster cheapoecono part doesnt mean race car bad actually really good part get worn job perform
racked mile sold regret day reliable car next vw bug fun car drive next porsche well built machine high maintenance
maintenance expensive people dont get shit fixed car sold used people dont know shit car theyre getting buy shit finally break neglect get slapped huge bill naive as go dealership repair people vocal basically unless youre mechanically inclined know youre getting people lease buy new covered warranty people stupid stretch something cant afford impress others theyll cut corner get even mean buying used one without repair history take gamble often doesnt work favor
owned couple bmw product mini cooper series cannot begin explain choose gasketseal material last compared lexussubarutoyota experience service life bmw gasket material japanese equivalent
ive heard explained longtime bmw motorcycle mechanic bmws designed assumption person building meticulous precise owner similarly meticulous maintenance shop mechanic break design doesnt like thing tolerance
bmws great kmmi need everything replaceable replaced great another need done little thing need done seems typical experience youre buying new awesome youre buying warranty theyre ok buying year old car km going reliable one km
consider maintenance owning brand vehicle
needy comparison japanese car give percent performance repair
mi hasnt issue breakdown regular maintenance item
found depends model pretty trouble free reliable aside big scheduled maintenance mile crazy maintenance said thing break get wallet need brake everything expensive fix replace model absolute fucking nightmare research buying realistic whether afford maintenance
buddy owned bmws said would never buy one many repair issue expensive maintain keep leasing new one every year great

sit reading typing xi wait windshield thaw say nothing good sure there little thing honestly worst oil leak min fix oil change regular time work alows one set brake last little rust front fender much live rust belt drive thing year round absolute shit weather
people always say maintain surely thats bad mean replaced part becomes problem still replaced part
many variable dumb reliable notoriously awful taken care ive two newer bmws currently needed stuff take par dead reliable two year ive right thats actually notoriously shitty motor ive load pre car absolutely turd nice reliable one people generally bitching maintenance cost second third owner wondering car higher level engineering failing dont change oil every ignore oil coolant leak
reliable cost arm leg maintain
non turbo model best far reliability note however car loaded electronics sensor prone either brief glitch making small problem apparent patience troubleshoot minor problem youll save service visit nice drive car
like car visit dealer per year oil change new year later
base model speed straight door sedan guy bought apparently second owner sure believe told couldnt sell going turn drift missile scrap kinda knew buying car rough life likely abused often ive owned year averaging year keep running inspected doesnt include gas insurance tyre thats maintenance garage cost dont skill tool space moment time maintenance cost would half ive done thing like oil change brake coolant bit spark plug im mechanic everytime drive like game make destination something break day year actually work one best car ive driven fastest handle really good sound ok feel new car dont ill never buy another bmw also dont plan getting rid one
expensive repair maintenance cost ive owned euro car followed english car crater bank account

sorry pic apartment reasonably large kitchen island pendant light centered one hang farther left end island like tall friend hit head bothering time lived im electrician particularly skilled handy person dont needed tool drill watched youtube video want live year come maybe decade ask landlord move idea agree
definitely dont without permission tenant never make electrical change permanent change kind ask landlord willing make change could even offer help pay interested thats decision fyi properly moving fixture work think doubtful enough existing wiring move want cant terminate add wire existing wiring make reach without adding unsightly junction box rewiring everything light switch possibly one could shorten wire make work depending run ceiling compared island wouldnt know got chance wired position would give excess wire versus enough wire long shot would also potentially significant amount drywall removed patched depending way ceiling joist run spacing joist compared centered island youre aware absolutely attempting rewire someone elses property
imagine dog leash dont want move dog move far leash imagine electrical device stuck wall light move much wire allow ish
take string pull side dont keep hitting head maybe tie two light run way something attach
pendant lamp hang chain want make one shorter tie link together
move island
would imagine landlord aware someone lack planning put stamp approval would minor pain move one would involve patching ceiling depending one skill would different kind eyesore moving two would double effort based wiring romex rigid conduit turn major project simpler solution would shorten another would eliminate one fixture cover box cover plate
always ask get extension like httpspreviewredditzkvoreipvepngwidthformatpngautowebpsfddfdbbebbcee pull pendent favorable place picture would help tell done without extension

ive owned almost year unreliable keeping properly maintained key want perform intended weakness addressed become expensive repair bmw owned tho experience limited
engine catastrophic engine issue require avoiding cost bigger issue seems use plastic component real stupid area related cooling ive looked used bmws recently dripping coolant somewhere
ive always found funny motorcycle opposite reputation least used
petrol extremely unreliable family owns dealership multiple issue booked one bmw told dont repair instead full engine replacement front back diesel bmws though reliable option
owned series arent expensive willing able work buy part online good thing relatively easy work especially one straight there quite bit room long engine bay bad thing lot sensor car seem go bad time
terrible car leased one brand new get towed twice would never get one
myth properly maintained fine although maintenance expensive
ive never issue understand plastic get brittle break address issue happen meaning follow maintenance schedule youll fine
people need learn
ive convertible since new year two thing went wrong within mile never go wrong new oil filter housing gasket new water pump know issue happen car bmw didnt anything neither covered based time mile ended getting back water pump due class action lawsuit sure wasnt lawsuit ofhg well wasnt towed least ive acuras lexus never towed love car reliable according consumer report newer one better bought new bmw convertible also repair expensive
theyre better used theyre best choice german luxury brand still nothing compared toyota honda part expensive labour often specialized
older bmw bought last year mechanical work far car reliable pretty easy service however couldnt give one later model theyre overengineered point ridiculousness whole purpose seems force owner back dealership everything oil dipstick wtf
arent say many pretty creaky day hard plastic especially black line trim
dont let sit idle extended period rescued series convertible apartment complex corpus christi sitting year ran upon jumping replace brake suspension im still hunting check engine light code
maintenance honda thats sure drive better honda
might lucky mile reliable minor issue outside normal maintainance full service history one previous owner though never problem left stranded anything like cant speak dealer price maintainance surprisingly easy work part mostly expensive normal car
ive owned used never anything would consider maintenancewear tear first left stranded water pump failure free aaa tow home weekend part running time said ive owned vehicle chevy hondas etc left stranded atleast stay away model based good straight engine solid specifically engine
ive series since ive replace tire far im diligent following maintenance schedule maybe thats hope get like
certain engine unreliable usn euro disaster timing chain basically disintegrated time leading catastrophic failure kind unreliable nothing crazy basic leak need fixed bseries truly one greatest engine ever made tank also phenomenal theyre objectively unreliable bmw would qualify hondatoyotalike engine europe theyre super logically assembled easy take apart awesome service manual stay top maintenance youre gucci
ive got couple neighbour look relatively reliable vehicle
bseries generally good engine designed together toyota least extremely solid engine hp zf automatic gearbox pretty much reliable best market outside quite lot golden pick id call need knowledge avoid look every single good option one big point need considered make engine good maintenance good maintenance make engine last good engine good paired good maintenance youll need look point failure generally always odd ball car shit factory assembly line effed nothing also bought used never know previous owner maintained drove maintenance perfect start car instantly give full throttle pushing right red line cold engine expect last forever performance car delusional car dead time short reliable user want
dad started lot issue like oil burning catalitic converter leaking radiator fan spinning max speed constantly even multiple trip garage etc replaced hasnt issue leaking headlight boring low power engine non car people regularly serviced dealer cant speak sportier car
son used work bmw dealership said people would come service department bragging awesome deal got used bmw upon inspection car needed thousand dollar repair buyer found hard way wasnt great deal said couple people simply abandoned car dealership
compared car owned far away expensive repair part labor ridiculous im high mileage driver afraid making paying repair car sucked much money
meh cost come fact many component fail old fiat used simple engine got okay mile gallon enough torque move around town bmw similar mpgs enough torque make smile come price though price paid maintenance
really depends model engine gen pretty bulletproof modern mi
owned two bmws low mile think theyre overrated po car road nothing super expensive problem car would
drive daily tolerant neglect something break costly repair unless replace couple thing overall great car engine problematic driven abusively cent
notoriously unreliable mile plenty go id say
never anything go wrong year competition new bmws proving reliable especially straight
nearly km got free year ownership maintenance repair buck im process replacing original alternator right honestly minute job refurbished part quarter price bmw wrecker everything need day automatic transmission number failed reverse gear one need replacing well seems weak point particular vintage looking manual swap funsies previous owner complete hack tho electrical repair something ive lot overall one pretty solid platform wouldnt want paying shop rate genuine part price fix
arent unreliable totally reliable problem talking maintenance repair cost think race car need engine rebuilt every race tire get changed many time single day performance bmw performance kind use lose scenario step corner stress bushing tire etc fun lot people think worth cost lot maintain quality part wear faster cheapoecono part doesnt mean race car bad actually really good part get worn job perform
racked mile sold regret day reliable car next vw bug fun car drive next porsche well built machine high maintenance
maintenance expensive people dont get shit fixed car sold used people dont know shit car theyre getting buy shit finally break neglect get slapped huge bill naive as go dealership repair people vocal basically unless youre mechanically inclined know youre getting people lease buy new covered warranty people stupid stretch something cant afford impress others theyll cut corner get even mean buying used one without repair history take gamble often doesnt work favor
owned couple bmw product mini cooper series cannot begin explain choose gasketseal material last compared lexussubarutoyota experience service life bmw gasket material japanese equivalent
ive heard explained longtime bmw motorcycle mechanic bmws designed assumption person building meticulous precise owner similarly meticulous maintenance shop mechanic break design doesnt like thing tolerance
bmws great kmmi need everything replaceable replaced great another need done little thing need done seems typical experience youre buying new awesome youre buying warranty theyre ok buying year old car km going reliable one km
consider maintenance owning brand vehicle
needy comparison japanese car give percent performance repair
mi hasnt issue breakdown regular maintenance item
found depends model pretty trouble free reliable aside big scheduled maintenance mile crazy maintenance said thing break get wallet need brake everything expensive fix replace model absolute fucking nightmare research buying realistic whether afford maintenance
buddy owned bmws said would never buy one many repair issue expensive maintain keep leasing new one every year great
good car high maintenance also hi tech engineering lot turbos etc toyota would personally drive new wasnt mechanically inclined
sit reading typing xi wait windshield thaw say nothing good sure there little thing honestly worst oil leak min fix oil change regular time work alows one set brake last little rust front fender much live rust belt drive thing year round absolute shit weather
people always say maintain surely thats bad mean replaced part becomes problem still replaced part

reliable cost arm leg maintain
non turbo model best far reliability note however car loaded electronics sensor prone either brief glitch making small problem apparent patience troubleshoot minor problem youll save service visit nice drive car
like car visit dealer per year oil change new year later
base model speed straight door sedan guy bought apparently second owner sure believe told couldnt sell going turn drift missile scrap kinda knew buying car rough life likely abused often ive owned year averaging year keep running inspected doesnt include gas insurance tyre thats maintenance garage cost dont skill tool space moment time maintenance cost would half ive done thing like oil change brake coolant bit spark plug im mechanic everytime drive like game make destination something break day year actually work one best car ive driven fastest handle really good sound ok feel new car dont ill never buy another bmw also dont plan getting rid one
expensive repair maintenance cost ive owned euro car followed english car crater bank account

argument friend group modding car regulation hurt car guy fun sport car went exhaust way regulation caused truck small useful tool giant monster truck sure spark interesting opinion main argument smog testing environment personally cant imagine people mod car cause big impact still researching portion
true car able whatever want within reason driven public road still need meet safety emission standard like everyone else exist reason
rell every time youre behind car doesnt cat pleasant feasible everyone say fuck got mine wed miserable wearing gas mask every time left house like la time think car regulation imagine everyone certain mod bad life would every single car straight piped horrendous
love muscle car car show much next guy gotta close exhaust dump reinstall muffler want drive residential neighborhood noise ordinance represent collective expectation society reasonable make amount noise time day obvious widely agreed wrote law someone violating shown look isnt one guy whining enforcing collective understanding society whole one who line quiet thing fuck consider doesnt apply noise
yes unless plan use street around people case need consider safety around
youre driving public road well use public thing gotta meet public rule exhaust screwing others also still rolling coal insane dont let house heating area either
yes unless modification put someone else danger
offroad use absolutely barring major environmental concern like mounting crop sprayer full dimethyl mercury grill go onroad use feel free modify way doesnt put others significantly increased risk remember right end somebody elses safety
right end hurt right others mod wake people roal coal residential zone yeah forbidden road use issue track car event tho ive always thought way dont asshole
epa estimated diesel truck eliminated emission system past year truck emit emission level equal million compliant vehicle tuned deleted diesel polluting environment rate higher left factory httpswwwepagovsitesdefaultfilesdocumentsepaaedletterreportontampereddieselpickupspdf level entitlement disregard everyone else frankly pretty disgusting opinion studded snow tire used relatively common law required removal certain calendar date spring time tear road nobody bat eye restriction people could see road would damaged caused society pay shouldnt approach air breath way
car truck bought work transportation sre seldom mod hideous variety however car also hobby people mod long engineered safety fine car canvas mod work art get car also competition mod power mod almost varied tattoo art type mod resell car factor thing enjoyment expression potential next owner factor trade resale value factor pure enjoyment ownership great thing talent technical ability courage anything vanilla driver
think car mod allowed unless negative impact safety driver carolina squat lift banned super high truck lift without lowered bumper compensate banned rolling coal since worsen visibility exhaust thats db level could cause hearing damage emission seem like waste time generally impact older car arent popular anyway
think able whatever want long still keep car safe meeting emission
point yes see reason vehicle rollover protection illegal legally lift suspension inch fit inch tyre cant lift inch run australia suck respect
modern car way efficient last longer advance like emission control people think smarter factory engineer arent
pa regard emission already handled two way rural county dont emission testing get away modified deleted cat system potentially higher emission sparsely populated area dont noticeable effect air quality car registered antique year old dont get state inspection therefore dont need pas emission test special rule submit photo car state basically promise youre driving mile year taking car show stuff there real checking dont report mileage etc could enforced really wanted crack think good idea first deleted emission dont really matter due low population less car per sq mile second car potentially deleted emission relegated driving mile less year keep road little experience state though state inspection emission testing like ohio right next dont think air quality issue could wrong though regard destruction light truck touched dont like either think due mpg requirement car weighing certain amount light truck small suv start meeting spec car wanted stay size rather emission still suck there also arm race america people awful driver perceiving theyre safer bigger bigger car theyll win accident dumb
personally cant imagine people mod car cause big impact diesel truck lot shop bringing ten million dollar like one thing someone build lotus replica want use modern engine cant engineer emission control another shop set almost exclusively disable emission ten thousand truck edit say someone owns diesel toy hot rodding disabling emission youre cheap fix break truck tremendous amount power come responsibility maintaining
yes people right modify property however want pretending civics modifying exhaust whats causing serious level climate change pollution completely absurd ridiculous doesnt make dent actual problem stopping
people deleting diesel thought thing gov levied massive fine right enshrined
fuck right end someone elses right begin want right clean air
diesel particulate matter hazard people health matter come come filter also there little carbon monoxide coming modern vehicle functioning emission system
neighbor car literally shake window cold start everyday yeah asshats need go
look want car like spider tank wild wild west able saying
yea long dont wake loud shit box exhaust every fucking morning
extent like thing cant spewing excess poisonous gas bad everyone wish truck would get smaller absurdly large big truck great doesnt fit need take tacoma size tundra dont know vehicle getting big
care lot safety regs emission regs passenger vehicle didnt really matter sx never gonna bad environment throwaway car horrible environment simply theyre waste resource id much rather see u move away commercial fleet vehicle absolutely emission regulated
dont like mod people say let em live long theyre happy im chilling
personal carstrucks banned except government use america modernize mandating bicycle mass transit cant walk bike bus work school legally required move closer one planet must protect environment oops dreaming liberal minute money spend like
define right nobody really right anything go term bill right whether allowed modify car see fit believe heard la terrible air quality back smog regulation helped change whether thats true dont know
yes enough people would mod car would major selling point fact back emission first introduced vehicle designed emission equipment could immediately deleted purchased lead everyone disabling emission nowadays expected cheat disable mean look happened quebec smog produced car industry suddenly killed flipping everything quebec lake due smog going becoming acid rain coming back horrible environment immediately around city limit smog
dont get endanger others environment fuck thing everyone else sharing public infrastructure like road selfish prick go fuck go build maintain private track
lived perfect world people would smart enough reasonable modification street live world people bolt fender flare using razor sharp decorative pointy bolt draw blood anyone accidentally get close jeep
right type whatever youd like purchased smartphone
right literally legally right isnt debate might able debate whether right debating whether able debate right simple dont right thats aftermarket part come disclaimer
legality aside one stupidest mod ive seen recently pointing nose pickup truck air like overloaded cool visibility must handle like crap one car show past weekend people kind snickered walked past
omg law yall wheel
hard modify car truck still meet whatever regulation place take effort aka awareness willingness as people road used tuned diesel dodge emission testing state really problem thing made huge power never black smoked thats wasted horsepower
within reason general pro modified car nearly every car ever owned modified fashion think need oversight first impact safety vehicle lower lift car well good slam jack moon safe need done quality part ive seen far many cheap junk part fail potentially putting operator car everyone else danger need done someone know inspected someone ive seen poor shoddy workmanship cause car literally burn ground rousing oil line shouldnt diy similar electrician stuff joe car owner stuff need signed fun long safe everyone else road diesel swap miata make
yes people able modify car freely long car wont pose significant safety risk consequence significant blinding oncoming traffic committing unscheduled disassembly self highway speed similar cause significant nuisance eg car especially loud maybe shouldnt driving around city night dont want fined sentenced community work
degree car mod danger people road ie carolina squat super bright lightbars headlight bright strobelights giant blade sticking wheel restriction aesthetic like massive spoiler big body kit underglow big stereo whatever
personaly cant imagine people mod car cause big impact werent illegal wouldnt people car manufacturer wouldnt design car emission component installed first place
mod leave vehicle unsafe condition year ago parade raleigh young girl marching dance troop killed highly modified pickup truck news report recall said brake failed maybe id feel better knew modification required thorough inspection system
certain extent yes car property afterall however modifying way make dangerous overly obnoxious illegal everywhere thing like really loud exhaust tinted window extremely low suspension really dim yellow light among thing illegal either dangerous overly obnoxious everyone around
people right modify car however want street use different argument regs exist keep people safe part im opposed
yes keep area intended drag car track monster truck dirt
there got balance dont think shouldnt allowed modify like germany think shouldnt wild everyone whatever want basic test required perform like emergency braking test wet asphalt emission testing people able modify see fit
depends state legally antique car diesel engine exempt anything else open pipe stupid people think loud fast idea exhaustion scavaging pulse back pressure reducing back pressure equal power safety dot guideline keep getting killed faulty equipment replacement part meet sae standard reason dont give fuk car look like long meet physical standard size wide long nothing come flying see weather light condition dont lose control sht im good
modify yes within bound society set got brake light example
seen absurd picture car world wouldnt set foot street knew theyd allowed live
almost depending state law lot mod loud tint dark even exhaust mod put check engine light would law lot place big fine even towing car want turn hp car hp sure nothing stopping want put rocket back car sure law one law go
want modify car however want always move register car location safety emission regulation live requires nothing title get tag go many surrounding municipality require emission safety testing think reasonably people live drive area meet standard obviously impractical loud modded car arent important find place
personally cant stand people straight pipe car dont want smell hear shit doesnt sound good probably lost power youre unnecessarily fucking clean air
think people get bit carried away however many manufacturer skimp area vehicle could use ease life longevity upgrade far messing exhaust system making loud dont care find annoying sometimes long theyre endangering others dick red lining neighborhood power em turbos super nice upgrade give engine little kick fun good tinted window need commuting ive rental without sunny day drive nut however blacked window dont understand people buy van want privacy back youre driving look dark legal tint job well tinted brake light seem like safety hazard overall limit modify believe probably people break anyways like straight piping blacked window freedom youd like property fully support
probably regionally dependant live illegal modify car way effect way operates thats say people dont anyway legal right
small number people mod car might big impact however guarantee number remain small
sovcit argument repackaged travel want modify vehicle want want thing public road paid government tax dollar need obey government rule regulation
modding car however want mean insane crackle pop tune stupidly loud smokey bullshit impact life also mod car however want
idc personally long polluting thing would say go feel like technology pollution low overall
sure long dont use public road pollute everyones air
however want way feel smoking smoke whatever hell want smoke tobacco weed toothpaste insect repellent care soon invades personal space get fucked dont want smell would apply anyone rolling coal otherwise spreading raw exhaust fume breathe theyre front far jacking truck sky youve aimed bumper head instead bumper would invite get fucked affect others
driving private road track whatever want soon public need obey law regulation

people dipshits modify car way make dangerous everyone around well like way uk modify however want long pass mot annual safetyemissions inspection
yeah see blackedout windshield blacked headlight lot around area wish didnt
think sensible require manufacturer include kind emission equipment dont think requiring owner retain emission equipment functional state testing make sense true vast majority people going modify vehicle dont care grand scheme thing pollution vehicle deleted emission equipment incredibly small compared much larger source tougher
question isnt really whatever want property end day car drive public road time sense car abide certain threshold safety environmental emission noise speed et cetera
need regulation car public road everywhere else whatever fuck want car
fun car enjoy way start effect people though respect others social contract build hp whip ill help wrenching fun take track highway intersection somewhere mess people didnt want party love sound truck im loud idle minute morning well driveway intruded bedroom one want really simple respect people good way make friend

dont think modification increase danger people allowed public road whether thats emission bumper height tint thats dark whatever else stuff endangers car strictly used offroad dont care personally cant imagine people mod car cause big impact still researching portion lack emission equipment make huge difference twostroke leaf blower emits substantially harmful emission fullsize suv like multiple time per hour runtime even close
dont mod legal also think something similar war drug people want get high going get high regardless like older hot rod carbed car massage get emission edge pointless exercise there lot top regulation thats really anything make everyones life difficult fraction percent really engaging im camp emission testing everyone complete waste time resource think lot pointless job repair shop obviously love taxpayer money would far better spent thing like public transportation catching someone functional egr valve say one mod piss anything though rolling coal would problem harsh penalty crowd

got car honda civic mileage changed transmission oil mileage around today went get oil change done mechanic told transmission oil black currently mileage around less km dont know change
transmission fluid darken time turn black quickly may indicate issue consider checking leak potential problem transmission unsure consult mechanic may recommend fluid change inspection diagnostics ensure transmission functioning properly
automatic manual know history transmission often flushed past wouldnt keep flushing black point hasnt regularly changed better leave alone
corolla im planning selling mechanically perfect condition ive done repair maintenance daily thing hood headlight atrocious im hoping restore headlight hood paint clear coat destroyed im wondering replace hood sell way would get money change hood would waste time money
waste time hood headlight diy hack bug spray spray scrub towel might take couple round theyre clear use something put protective coat wax ceramic detail spray fine toothpaste also work basically mild abrasive
youd likely able sell higher price may wash consider part labor get fixed
paint
look like total shit rattlecan itll probably also look bad better
buy kit fix headlight leave hood corolla recommended car ever someone buy
agree others hood would waste time effort wont increase sale value make worth headlight however would make world difference cleaned im huge fan diy would actually see walmart near auto care center headlight restoration u im assuming youre u price absolutely worth let done vehicle one even year old civic came good new
ive lot work car hood also bad shape cracked paint need stripped repainted dont intend sell time soon repainting would selling probably wouldnt paint although id first check whether could recoup cost soughtafter car thats increasingly hard find internals solid case might actually pay maybe
find matching one great shape thats big cosmetic issue sure waste time
wrap hood polish headlight
possibly find hood match fairly cheap pull yard otherwise wrap attempt rattle match wrap much safer bet headlight restoration kit cheap
headlight yes would anything hood reason repainting even professional would judged suspicion people immediately think vehicle sort accident lot car paint issue since government mandated waterborn auto paint
year find clean one scrapyard like perhaps worth
went thing recently corolla mile ran like new hood clear coat left building paint started peeling headlight fogged debated painting self can clear coat junkyard hood condition ended selling car friend kid want maximize payout might worth didnt want deal personally
try sell hard time get new used hood paint frugal possible
year color toyota issue white paint repair free sometimes
reason didnt include year model mileage

theory friction material transmission longer supposed rather fluid remove fluid friction material replace nice new slippery fluid transmission may slip rendering useless
toyota world havent done every mile would recommend never however owner want done obviously there always chance itll never move power shop came corvette ton mile said thing however owner insisted replaced everything sure enough zero forward gear
advice change fluid come past experience transmission neglected point starting display symptom owner decided try change fluid upon service inevitable happens transmission fails shop technician blamed happening vehicle owner wanted repaired free many case ultimately happens shop get ripped tried usually still get badmouthed even take huge loss repair
slip change broken transmission begin
clunk slipping catching gear burned old fluid contaminates cause wear lead slipping change regularly keep dont change dont slipping old fuid contaminates friction clean fluid old fluid could reason still working clunking grabbing may delay rebuild replacement v change assuming already going bad
suck telling someone yea car drove fine fucked going cost
seems hit miss early mercury something like mile overdue fluid old fluid came looking like mud decided change transition rd th bit rough new fluid filter didnt seem change much anything still delay followed mild jerk rd th mph several year later slip transition st nd change fluid filter thing put bottle lucas stop slip still keep going going mile fluid stay clean welp gonna keep rolling lol
regular change good havent regularly changed fluid exacerbate problem even doesnt likely wont fix anything
old people dont understand correlation equal causation transmission fluid change start acting little bit changed fluid fail shortly obviously fluid change caused
saying isnt mechanic ase automatic transmission curriculum took last year hear story going way definitely following ase defer consensus
friend bought vw propaganda shouldnt andor cant change atf jetta tdi decided change fluid filter downshift becoming problematic changing fluid filter shifting problem became manageable sold car helped new owner service transmission two year ago car still running original transmission
havent servicing transmission regular interval dont change fluid new fluid fresh detergent may harm good end washing material friction plate sound like time new transmission sorry bearer bad news
majority time get changed either use wrong fluid andor put much little wouldnt think hard apparently also doesnt help bazillion different fluid spec v year ago
slipping tranny jeep took old put thickening stuff solve problem cant go second still drive fine taking easy shift repressing gas
suck drain fluid add lucas transmission additive worked great year gm transmission
fresh detergent new fluid make debris come loose plug orfices damage internal component
clunk something simple enginetransmission mount odds inside transmission wouldnt shifting properly mostly myth change fluid break transmission transmission already failing already changed fluid regardless car id change really cant make worse actually failing good chance fine though either need relearn fluid service
pressurized flush drain refill flush high mileage cause issue drain fill removing material would ended filter anyway
changing every mile probably would predicament lucas transmission witchcraft stuff pray start saving transmission
toyota master tech explains video around min httpsyoutubetevkuvkxthttpsyoutubetevkuvkxt
change trans fluid maintenance start acting shifting funny youre better leaving till doesnt work anymore especially car get changed stop working week dont care toyota engine might last million mile whatever transmission lifespan like well taken care car longer bunch easy highway driving
vehicle would drop pan replace filter replace amount came would fluid flush flushing system machine mess transmission
honda accord drain fill trans fluid week later transmission hasnt done history unknown say leave alone
toyota lifetime fluid like gm say sealed unit change anyway car plus mile never fluid changed thats reason theyre telling change run risk losing clutch material fine
acurahonda recommend method
friction material also flow bearing gear causing additional wear causing wear prematurely changing fluid cause slippage transmission already need replacement
mechanic dont say dealership push onto tech lifetime fluid something go youll buy new car parent audi fan take care car turned several time requesting fluid change even denied tire rotation ive literally told sir audi require tire rotation quattro awd tech sad effort theyll put profit sorry rant find indy mechanic
well im gonna say yes admit neglected car point almost pontiac gt never changed transmission fluid filter car seems running fine ive thought changing im debating problem hate enclosed system dont transmission dipstick make hard yes could gone mechanic put lift changed way charge way much car level ground level check fluid plug
theyre old believe fairy tale crud holding transmission together
short answer misinformed believe myth unfortunately perpetuated industry due people incorrectly performing fluid filter maintenance uninterested learning truth incapable admitting theyve wrong long
transmission old thing keeping working sludgy transmission fluid clutch metal shaving like friction modifier keep transmission slipping remove thing start slip consensus maintain regularly maintain
wait change trans fluid till problem youre gonna problem
well quite frankly fluid probably holding transmission together nice old replace youre bound probably issue guess could remove fluid clean pan something replace transmission filter refill trans old fluid sure say world standard transmission fluid doesnt need changed
wait youre th camry since
changing fluid getting flushed kill think transmission one way pump flush fluid get pushed wrong way blow inner seal dumping fluid removing pan replacing said fluid fine done regularly reference auto manually
fluid burnt changing actually make transmission slip shifting due increased lubricity
least back friction material would deteriorate acidity new fluid leading myth old fluid full stuff held transmission together actually new fluid would destroy myth pervasive day friction material changed susceptible change ph manufacturer even say okay change fluid mile fluid dont know effect new fluid day
nothing wrong changing fluid transmission oil burnt civic bought second hand changed fluid problem till date one buddy driving altima km mile felt transmission slip advised change fluid hasnt problem since nissan known transmission issue
im year old purchased new mercury broahm transmission went mile mile warranty repaired atv mile went swore would never buy american made vehicle since driven toyota many mile never changed transmission fluid flushed transmission never transmission issue
come dont change fluid there problem suspect problem may end transmission performs better worse change change proper interval last really long time wait there problem there chance fail soon change imo better fail predictably rather randomly
manufacturer state lifetime fluid service interval
start fluid change make worse mean need new transmission anyway unless youre pushing old fluid torque converter need drain fill multiple time driving dozen mile drain change filter transmission need proper hydraulic pressure work could easily solenoid weak mount well
theyre afraid getting blamed transmission fails change fluid filter ive changed fluid filter every single car ive daily driven never hurt includes car mile likely original fluid filter ive done transmission already slipping still helped shift better customer blame mechanic stupidest thing theyre going risk lawsuit make change fluid filter youll better
havent seen mentioned yet also debris settle transmission passage debris settled somewhere hasnt caused failure adding new fluid could pick deposit move cause failure
ive always followed rule working ok replace fluid dont wait till started acting funny start maintaining
several origin mostly myth way back automatic transmission used use sperm whale oil handy dandy thing called endangered specie act came stop using sperm oil instead made synthetic werent good synthetic better transmission full sweet delicious whale oil replaced lousy synthetic garbage could fail shortly fact automatic transmission failure increased fold year immediately passage endangered specie act reason stuck around transmission start slipping people try change fluid fix late transmission fails anyway people blame fluid change fail regardless flushing transmission dislodge deposit end clogging passage somewhere transmission creating issue personally recommend drain fill rather flush even doesnt replace fluid refill transmission wrong level wrong fluid create issue
bought tacoma year ago changed everything transmission rear differential steering brake fluid clunk starting stopping fluid change clunk completely went away shifted smoother truck still running kid truck good luck
youre risking knocking loose built sludge friction material would come fluid change atf lot detergent new fresh detergent get clean sludge wash place dont want sludge course changed fluid regular oldwivestale question apply want risk could flush absolute living crap theory fine sister honda probably saved transmission people lucky also probably super expensive mechanic instead older brother feeling pretty ballsy
change fluid bump gear normally mean one solenoid sticky may solve issue see easy swap
change yes flush
ive never heard tech transmission shop say change transmission fluid lot even say dont flush transmission sure flush cooler transmission additive fluid degrade get consumed depleted fluid loses beneficial property thats reason fluid change reason flushing sealing done transmission unfortunately come gunk get deposited valve body channel losing extra sealing worn transmission component lead poor pressure causing poor shifting slippage
need deep swallow
change starting low mileage okay never changed dont start
transmission fluid longer life span cvts want scientific answer
lab tell service exactly condition fluid guessing excessive maintenance oil change needed like blood test medicine preventive care
year wrenching happened twice ford chevy truck fluid brown smell kind burnt leave alone shop sure inform customer consequence changed
look toyota service manual tell change transmission fluid unfortunately likely gone far long dirty oxidized plain worn fluid started grenade transmission fluid change may cause total failure point dislodge sludge clutch material small crevice valve body make pas area supposed causing shift issue noise coming transmission replace point source im master toyota tech
also depends frequently change happened one missed couple change new fluid could cause harm good day plan replacing transmission thats company say life time oil subaru forester changed trans fluid cause lot city driving top roading
nothing manual old never life changed trans fluid topped even extremely rare
many transmission fluid change vehicle never transmission crap knock wood
rtfm
misshifting single dump fill replace fluid replenish friction modifier fluid degrade time exposure moisture lifetime fluid lie majority time sort misshift doesnt wont harm improves shifting completely another dump fill transmission clutch wear eventually wear fail maintaining fluid wear faster flush old transmission stir friction material sludge pan run valve body causing badthingstm happen
drain fill usually fine flush knock shit loose get stuck dont want havent keeping maintenance
year ago transmission builder trading work said showed recommended never changing fluid first thing almost car oil soap detergent compound atf soap detergent surface wear cleaning buildup happen atf disappears little added almost status quo happens little bit added doesnt change anything whole new amount atf added cleaning action full strength soapdetergent remove good buildup causing instant wear failure showed part truly worn failure automatic transmission many grimy almost new measurement wear part showed worn beyond reason part coming transmission less milage shinny clean worn completely less milage worn completely transmission atf changed grimy part worn higher milage transmission topped needed builder recommended never changing atf shop owner oversold full atf change
mile transmission truck bought never fluid change ever decided part overhaul drain flush refill trans fluid came looked like heavily burned oil transmission immediately upon first time putting gear slammed slipped failed shift etc two fluid change majority fluid torque converter doesnt come standard drain fill changed trans filter time finally got trans fluid red maybe total fluid change truck doesnt like shift nd gear replaced shift solenoid refill finally act normal moral story yes friction material fluid help draining cause issue depositing gunk throughout path downwards clog solenoid etc possible recover time faint hearted might good idea
watched youtube video recommend looking
friend worked automotive manufacturing industry say factory transmission fluid better counter fluid buy always recommended going dealer heater filter machine service original fluid transmission last lasted year transmission issue ownership procedure done life truck know people argue truck well mile never touched transmission except way
would want know first tif changed ever ago every whatever swap heavily used transmission fluid grit new stuff slickno grit actually make transmission shift worse able happen pretty easy diy though sell additive put grit transmission fluid help prevent loss shifting youtube video got several car maintenance repair work saving ton hope help
here believe year driving experience several transmission issue running new low mileage vehicle change fluid early often like every go mile without tranny service pan leak drain half fluid top new repeat every get beyond service dont bother anything gonna shock system top fluid needed run til there issue
repeat heard told without personal evidence evidence ase master tech since serviced vehicle shop toyota specialist never single trans failure could linked fluid change one would perform fluid service make risk transmission failure could fault anyone understands inner working transmission know fluid vital lubrication operation clutch brake valve fluid break becomes contaminated increase wear advising someone leave wrong rare occasion story come happened myfill blank ignores thousand fluid change flush go fine keep car road
thunk eaither mount valve body need replacing
simple dont full flush keep diluted partially old fluid measure come add much back slippery fluid cause slip old worn simply keep fluid fresher itll run cooler last longer neglect grenade
read manual
change expect detergent new fluid break loose build clog solenoid problem get worse bring back shop fix mint people never second step assume broken
often difficult however data show transmission performance shifting durability massively improved regular oil change
think holdover myth say go owner manual fluid changed regal g socalled sealed system need special machine im mile fluid change shouldnt number year
ive always heard old dont change might cause slip within regular maintenance keep fresh
corolla mile got transmission fluid never changed single issue slipping catching let ride
time either new transmission transmission rebuild reason dont change transmission fluid nothing move place break goto use several dozen disk material transmission worn center shift cause issue car mile transmission mile replacing blow ever happens first
well here experience camry friend camry friend something ford van lexus northeast car year plus original transmission fluid city highway driving experiencing major rust point care transmission car original fluid mechanic plus year say leave alone dealership maintenance book think changing doesnt guarantee longer life waste money especially day real careful certain temperature like changing oil wouldnt trust anybody job youre always running chance something going wrong rav day im changing fluid speed expect least im already surprised many people never change transmission fluid go year many people end problem whatever stay away lucas stuff
want change go ahead youre taking small gamble want leave alone likely go without transmission issue
one high mile likely never changed fluid change avoided
myth isnt true bmw transmission fucked couldnt break mph would shift slam every gear sometimes slip gear mechanic told best bet transmission rebuild simple fluid change mile later year still running perfect shift smooth slippage problem whatsoever month symptom persisted slowly went away another fluid change even bucking st nd went away another month later silverado never trans fluid change ever thing mechanic told needed new trans torque converter started slipping well fluid change ran right rain still mile later lmao even corolla mile got symptom transmission problem changed trans fluid symptom gone torque converter stopped slipping transmission quieted change smoothed shifting slowly happened week first change wasnt instant gunk need slowly dissolved myth perpetuated oldheads trying way hard think intuitively mechanic see damage transmission tend flush fluid change myth fluid change damage worn transmission came flush bad part free gunk put new place sometimes take part already close last leg cause totally new problem youre supposed change fluid little often gunk like engine gunked want slowly dissolve instead dislodging add trans fluid change transmission still running good youre high mileage incur problem issue folk come first fluid change well experience symptom bad trans fluid replace fluid sometimes problem dont randomly go away depending issue trans perfect condition replace fluid going cause issue issue already present
transmission already hurting make worse specifically already slipping every mile depending type transmission good practice
following recommendation manufacturer service
older car went shop transmission oil changed going forward reverse loud bang reverse plate shattered
people saying change fluid oil probably armchair mechanic fault mention torque converter clutch sticking deapply due hydraulics fluid allowing slip properly add fm like lubegard shudder fixx fix need replace fluid fm addition confirmation test fluid spent remember lifetime fluid lifetime term used lawyer ask meaning come life equipment independent similar unit meaning clunk lifetime clunk thats lifetime
thought heavy equipment tech youre preventative measure known issue youre probably good change changing fluid already problem usually exasperate issue automotive world usually best save flush money payment new transmission point
ram say replace tow lot fluid still look pink nice fluid filter replacement todo list month
im fine drain fill old transmission never serviced flush ive issue old unmaintained transmission trans flush machine
theory seems transmission already less destroyed still operating continue operating longer fluid isnt changed may true still going start problem soon either way fine fluid changed ruined everything also probably ton people dont anything late trans acting get fluid changed blame causing failure resulted getting fluid changed month ago think case like putting bandaid someone stage cancer blaming bandaid die
transmission tech reason wont simple fluid service high mileage vehicle especially one service history issue get worse service liable
real reason ultimately liability
bought nissan xterra auction sitting coyote year every would shift fucked make horrible noise got fluid changed shift like butter mile btw
goshthis dillema question getting popular debate chicken egg
new vehicle cant even fluid changed designed go kk shut
changed fluid regular basis every mile go ahead first time risk causing failure automatic transmission operate hydraulicly fluid serf many function lubrication cooling hydraulic operation transmission many servo apply piston various clutch operating transmission fluid pressure fluid collect friction material clutch wear friction material wear rubber teflon seal allow transmission operate change fluid regularly kept minimum wear get worse friction material start fill gap wear created flush material seal start leak cause slippage slippage cause excessive wear heat lead failure inevitable walk home mode hope help generally transmission regularly serviced flush otherwise vehicle pan replaceable filter replace filter whatever fluid come change approximately leave itnon serviceable filter
simple google save hassel reading junk troll legit answer
drain fluid change filter usually work well ill never go another transmission flush though old girl slipped like mad put lucas helped little
back day transmission doesnt drain plug pan gasket pain leak common
transmission need maintenance like anything else vehicle difference people see sealed unit unlike engine transmission fluid pick metal like engine oil changing stop getting place cause problem
owned subaru outback cylinder cvt manufacturer maintenance schedule cvt fluid lifetime owner swore asking trouble didnt faithfully change every thirty thousand mile heard story dealer stated recommend changing fluid asked owner like never changed per manufacturer recommendation opinion vary sure fwiw never issue mile traded
kind flush bad transmission id probably spill fill new filter reluctant could always siphon quart add back fresh fluid kind step right direction
always refer owner manual first
old wife tale shop dont want touch transmission way overdue likelihood failure much higher unmaintained unit due new fluid due fact owner requesting theyre problem due poor maintenance ive corrected problem transmission flush filter going fix burned unit friction material fluid block filter giving extra grip worn clutch
one problem people usually want replaced something wrong instead replacing preventative maintenance done regularly prevent issue longterm
dump fill filter change manual unless fairytale lifetime service mumbo jumbo mile cvts apparently lower interval flushing dont worry whats torque converter basic thing
transmission fluid gear oil massive amount detergent dispersments mean fluid disollves gunk tranmission addatives keep junk stasis cause harm automatic transmission there ton tiny passage easily clogged transmission fluid cannot solve metalso something get stuck there good chance destroys entire transmission said ive never seen simple drain full flush cause problem doesnt mean issue already drain fill cause many case fixed problem
theyre complete idiot there legitimate reason change fluid old
certain mechanic hillbilly superstition training boil never find actual data support

hello everyone wanted see others issue replaced model rwd tire second time car mile car eat rubber first mile another tire rotation nd set tire even wear live socal dry weather get heavy rain occasionally didnt want risk low tread get credit since tire warranty able get new michelen primacy one road hazard certificate seemed like good deal surprised lasting mile brand type drive style replace soon perhaps
mile isnt bad could get mile accelerated less aggressively imo worth tire wear item fun enjoy driving car
seems normal ive seen tesla naturally torquey acceleration spin hair add also factor weight model quite bit heavier camry
ev eat rubber expect chew tyre often ice car
small car weighs almost lb butt load instant torque pretty decent considering fact
lot reading online noticed people mention swap tire model much faster compared previous car assumption maybe electric vehicle heavier compared gas car experience dont think thats main culprit may contributing factor im currently still first set tire still tread life im starting believe due driver maybe due aggressive driving im also located socal constantly freeway road terrible
much heavier car power alongside skinny tire low tread begin eat tire
tire tesla seems pretty okay eat tire youre pretty decent
pretty normal get kk mine
instant high torque eats rubber one unfortunate downside ev design without appropriate torque vectoring reducing wear tyre
key difference gas electric gas engine build peak torque dont get rpm doesnt typically doesnt start peak least rpm minimum depending engine size configuration tire arent fighting power time even throttle wide open beauty electric power based engine speed get rpm range throttle wide open tire fact contend power time electric engine need nanny help regulate traction throttle used even gas instant torque induces havoc tire wear faster tire similarly powerful gas engine unless super conscious gonna real world cost electric vehicle tire wear mark telling need replaced unlikely replaced early unless mark werent taken account

hello everyone question regarding car audi tfsi gift mother sentimental value plan keep long possibleuntil longer run car great daily driving id like enhance experience enjoy even im looking way improve car soundsomething legal extreme nice noticeable sound enjoy open window still plan buy car future one stay want make anyone recommendation legal modification improve sound without going overboard thank

someone selling car cheap sitting year driving im literally year old idea
bring someone bought multiple car private party successful outcome go look
there lot kind impossible without knowledge
depends car youre getting cheap first car dont almost going worm youll probably need minimum drain fuel potentially replacing fuel pump tire brake pad rotor engine oil brake fluid battery etc thats also assuming critter got made home also assuming there mold anywhere easily grand part maybe labor depending shop area youre getting project totally different story
check clear title car first come back clean salvage title due insurance reason drain oil replace oil oil filter drain gas tank easy transfer pump drain radiator flush get new tire spark plug check wire hood dash rodent chew wire good get new battery said car worth time money investing
kind car sitting outside cover itll need new battery fresh fuel would helpful parked outside check mold interior
figure drain fuel first dont want shoot old fuel engine clog injector
best advice give walk away especially idea youre look
ask test drive car first
worst thing car let sit right hard acceleration sat likely reason unless good toyota thats likely go micerats may chewed wire unless ofc ur city slicker
run complete opposite way shade tree mechanic year
ask seller would okay taking shop pre purchase inspection many independent shop charge reasonable fee service know next nothing car would money well spent thats option find friend family member co worker know car come look
there probably reason stopped driving bring someone thats experienced car tire might need replacing year old even lot tread left
lot great advice changing fluid plug tire checking everything dont worry knowing learn im almost pretty good car engine yet would still consult pro give car check would buy hundred dollar part labor mechanic many thing dont feel crash course everything everywhere especially old car new mechanic friend may become best friend owning first car joy lesson humility

hey everyone lexus e dont drive muchmostly short trip parked garage time last oil change done dealer june mile used synthetic oil likely mobil something similar today april im mile ive driven mile since last oil change dealer sticker say change oil mile im nowhere near however almost year since last change know usual advice change synthetic oil every mile month im curious think car thats barely driven always garaged go ahead change oil time safe wait hit mileage anyone else gone longer year synthetic oil low mile real risk dealermanufacturers upsell would love hear experience thought thanks
change mine yearly even dont hit mileage also good time check fluid filter wiper blade etc
would change year short trip good oil
would change typically every mile matter recommended year something isnt driven often youre looking year max dont risk engine something minor
change year never hit mile
smell dipstick smell petrol blowby cold running short trip change oil immediately diluted gasoline dribbling piston ring
op fwiw drive vehicle mile annually always renew oil every month question asked
kind mileage change yearly wife drive avalon engine model short distance every day change oil every six month mile whichever come first rarely mile
definitely change oil oil break time especially really chemically altered synthetic oil like heard either way oil lot additive break even separate especially driven regularly also oxidize get moisture thus lubricating system properly best follow rule change oil specified mileskilometers month depending oil
always annually never hit mileage
thousand mile year truck change every year trip long enough fully heat engine drive fuel water oil short trip murder oil since said short trip would changing annually good synthetic every mo conventional oil
short trip severe service see owner manual change oil sooner later
jaguar put mile year change oil every year take hour consider insurance
try change mine twice year end summer end winter full synthetic expensive would probably go yearly mine
oil break time best replace
send sample lab analysis help determine correct service period exact case
wouldnt worry like oil suddenly go bad youll fine make sure level correct however another commenter said good idea check vehicle make sure light work suspension tight sort thing rubber absolutely degrade time span
twice year min regardless milage metric hit
changed annually owned exact car maybe easiest car ever change oil personally would use oil instead im fairly sure thats lexus recommended factory era
change oil rubber degrade oxygen water air cant run away simply staying indoors though thin car unless hybrid
yeah change degrades bit time
one year month whichever come first
change quart oil plus oil filter plus minus quart change oil
type mile change oil beginning every driving season put away hibernation end year probably overkill know oil cheap plan keeping car forever

sound like mechanic youve seen arent worth damn straightforward issue solve need attach gauge ac system service port read freon level closed system losing freon leak complain work little refill almost certain case ac compressor going turn freon level drop low system prevent burning freon keep component lubricated determining source leak obviously seen would involve adding freon special dye make much easier spot coming anyone bothered even try going proper process adding dye properly tracking leak using guess work firing part cannon usually right approach
sad say possibility ac system car massively underengineerd compared actual ac system supposed ask actual ac mechanic use rubber seal likely slap face problem mostly constand pressure change going emty full couple time compered old fragile part ring replaced hose car ring started leaking compressor failed evaporater leaking im mechenic wasnt screwed misdiagnosed shop system work long work year become fragile

mate put oil car since car could checker told toturns okay run oil bit time oil change oil aint cheep student life stuff hard tyia
actually protect work best manufacturer switched thinner oil improve fuel economy fact car sold different market north american car require others require bring downvotes
youre going get straight answer different school thought people say always use manufacturer recommended viscosity engine others say okay increase viscosity engine get older dad one increase viscosity car got older always stuck see getting older burning quart oil every oil change see logic wanting put something thicker think youll okay especially toyota engine completely understand opposing point well flip coin
fine daughter cx recommends exact engine europe recommend thinner oil emission arguably worse engine run
better engine recommended get rounding error better fuel economy trade saving like cent week fuel engine wear

would start voltage drop test alternator battery battery body ground also test alternator body negative terminal sure wiggle wire voltmeter connected doesnt reveal issue try letting engine idle park disconnect battery negative terminal monitoring alternator voltage output amperage output youve likely got either wiring issue alternator thats fails produce enough voltsamps load
alternator marginal get hot stop charging drive mile test idle accessory ac blower high headlight wiper ill bet drop less
tell alternator test performing test testing alternator print out test
alternator test providing isnt enough fried voltage rectifier thats sending bad dirty current battery also bad ground somewhere would first check assuming alternator actually tested properly
suspect alternator ive seen charge fine get really warm testing engine running tell charging right well need done battery light dash course also agree comment loose connection also bit long shot alternator pulley oneway clutch style maybe slipping load
load test done
loose connection somewhere ground battery cable
ok battery wont go dead car left turned battery ok idling battery light battery light come driving bit battery go dead battery light come shut back pull foot gas guess im wondering bad connectionwire somewhere alternator connection battery perhaps alternator poorly grounded try wobbling wire around engine idling see trigger battery light test done alternator battery clear doesnt seem like replaced alternator battery correct
alternator test include testing ripple alternator could putting diode bad one every three four wave rectifier lost giving really fast uneven current could dead spot brush check specific rpm causing speed load thats case alternator requires rebuilding replacing last thing think check connection clean solid connection may seem like good connection idle may heat extra current engine speed
loose connection check alternator positive cable course negative positive battery terminal highest suggest remove terminal clean well corrosion make sure mating surface clear reconnect spray terminal protectant
symptom describing sound like alternator charging specific point vehicle requires voltage alternator cannot keep draining battery testing alternator idle giving false reading alternator taken bench tested checked relay hood fuse
get voltage meter terminal runnig see amp youre getting something causing drain substantially alternator pas good test becausr charge checking amp see actually charging enough keep driving
sure alternator belt right tight truck doesnt automatic serpentine belt tensioner manual serpentine belt tensioner set tension also tight bet mechanic leaving loose
something similar happen truck bearing going would intermittently lock belt noise either surprisingly enough battery light come done visual check alternator
issue fatherinlaws van connected volt meter van idled came back later voltage dropped apparently shop handled suspension work didnt connect cable ran engine battery alternator new check connection
battery alternator cable voltage regulator
autozone oreillys mechanic tested mechanic used multimeter said putting right amount voltage also diode test passed said alternator charging able pull battery cable truck running still run got paperwork
battery alternator tested
need alternator normal condition toyota alternator bench test fine charge vehicle
keep idling yard ac light load system may short driving uninsulated cable contacting frame battery shorting internally vibrating exc check alternator amperage output inductive clamp correct voltage charging

yes interference engine cam belt coming apart mean piston kissed bent valve engine possible seized fixed may need new head new piston check metal debris oil check cylinder wall etc usually cheaper put used engine non interference engine good retime engine slap new belt doubt case
belt keep everything time engine operate need suck bang blow accurate time time operates course also part right spot right time specifically piston valve valve open upstroke stuff gonna bent
cam belt time distance replacement interval ever come first followed otherwise belt break belt break yes engine need replaced isnt fixable usually cost twice much fix replace
cam belt turn cam shaft open close valve depending engine designed broken belt result significant damage engine engine stuck open valve contacted piston continue going repair usually replacing belt engine stick valve impacted moving piston damage extensive minimum youre looking replacing valve piston might ha cracked head even block depending bad point repair cost usually higher replacing engine
realistically dont need replace motor best case send head engineering shop replace bent valve make sure everything spec put motor back together worst case replace damaged piston head work probably cheaper drop motor fix least fix know exactly know motor buy sitting red line whole life drop valve day buy come day warranty normally im pretty sure unfortunate bastard bought motor tdi regret buying motor sold car scrap million km realistically needed bearing ring probably rebore oversized piston doubt cost exactly much planning spending original motor

im sure flair put
tool experience local part house level ford flex
depends vehicle situation money pit
range rover still cost double flex v right id rather two tricked ford flex please thats generous see one rover autotrader right
whatever reliable baseline variable would buy land rover
depends much money afford spend maintenance repair give better choice land rover id premium car prefer quality afford buy used premium suv cash like new one pay upkeep per year wouldnt cause financial stress
keep car long time option mean shit break
wouldnt trim land rover warranty
top trim cheaper car bought car base model car ended spending money add option available base level
exception generally would spring top trim cheaper car luxury nickel dime entire way cold weather package nah separate heated seat steering wheel wiper
family owned several basemodel acuras generally preferred equivalent loaded honda pricing isnt different however would buy neither vehicle youve listed wouldnt wish land rover anyone here good explanation whyhttpsmyoutubecomwatchvjuczhgswg dont want watch video doug demuro famous car fan youtuber bought used range rover carmax bought bumpertobumper warranty cost warranty expired repair totaled carmax since nearly tripled cost warranty expensive keep road fire easy say passport lot better car edge id also pick outback frankly even pathfinder ford weird midsized group suv journey worse touareg hyundaikia class grenading engine skip
cooler car less feature less cool car feature
wouldnt buy range new year old range money pit would rather top range accord v bottom level series
would drive ford anything land rover anything
depends engine base trim bunch different engine want big one
driven german luxury sedan year made big change bought base model minivan wanted simplicity reliability happy give many thing dont like leather sunroof adjust seat lowprofile wheel tire make look good higher sidewall mean comfort theyre less expensive fancy body trim mean fewer place moisture get stuck cause rust manual transmission simple low maintenance im longer trying impress anyone car feature want highertrim model usual add im extremely happy gone basemodel route
know im really answering question way asked personally go expensive car definitely range rover year two older get top trim im way picky get base model also way picky settle every single time get car im going pissed settle lol
base model
go set money fire yard want buy range rover itll basically end
mean realistically lower maybe bottom trim cheaper car two option top trim cheaper car expensive car expensive maintenance
lot people love flex
owned entry level range rover fully loaded kia id take kia day kia better technology feature also easier maintain much reliable id never buy luxury brand unless money wasnt factor could go edit would like add quality material kia complete junk compared range rover could see someone would prefer base model expensive vehicle something bother much
ford flex limited might shop less kinda saying something plus cheap top trim car often luxury feature material expensive base model lack even land rover keep good stuff higher trim vote flex
top trim cheaper car always
paper doesnt justice nvh reduction would personally go lower trim nicer car range rover lol
everyone keep bashing rover keep cheap ill keep buying penny dollar two full size supercharged range rover best luxury suv mile sure arent toyota reliable similar ford chevrolet honestly hell engine stamped fomoco side keep servicing know couple weak spot solid given choice ill always go rover option always first choice
would sooner research base decision ever one likely less trouble longterm nothing worse constantly fix car
man really depends sometimes situation base trim simple nice look top trim overwhelming
wouldnt rover free
laugh land rover driver bunch mark
bought lincoln rather ford reliable driveline comfort feature
here anecdote experience two car drive regularly brand new midlevel trim vehicle provided work assisted self driving adaptive cruise control car play lot newer tech feature standard super luxury doesnt leather fancier audio system everything new also year old truck time nearly top trim level im working drive work vehicle personal use choose drive year old truck comfortable like reliable still may fancy would much rather drive arguably much much nicer new car
daily base model cheaper car id rather spend dough thing keeping jones
good question recently would opted buy upgraded nonluxury brand car market shifted fully upgrading normal car cost almost much lower end luxury equivalent thing never available budget brand car matter many toy option big one comfort nvh noise vibration harshness cruising highway lower end vehicle even fully optioned noticeably louder higher drone road noise even base line luxury vehicle luxury live vehicle often equipped laminated glass side window greater sound deadening material quieting road noise higher end tire quieter road surface spend new honda similar sized midrange lincoln acura look closely lot feature honda wont offer cabin comfort ease access concierge service pick updrop service appointment pretty standard luxury brand top everything else luxury brand usually lower volume sale attractive lease financing option often lower interest rate nonluxury brand end day good deal lot price paid happy bought reason price likely keep car longer
conversation someone year ago figured finally put word customize vehicle buy one make car truck want example like drivetrain suspension lacking trim level includes lot nice feature wheel large there much chrome really like toptier trim package doesnt come engine andor transmission want shopping vehicle figure want try get close purchase lot private seller put additional fund making wantneed might involve suspension work swapping feature higher trim aesthetic mod may answer looking approach decision presented two vehicle option

expensive car expensive repair said sl want
base trim expensive car
arent really comparable though lr higher price point matter trim relative rest line like trying compare expensive casio watch cheapest rolex completely different market
top trim end user experience depend feature use daily basis buying empty box lr give less satisfaction fully loaded ford especially mean lr come base engine ford would come top engine well
friend dont let friend buy land rover
would want either two car listed think woud like one higher trim car medium trim ive always wanted higher trim
top trim japanese car itll reliable
current situation exactly got civic type cayenne base enjoy
top trim cheaper car one dream gr yaris
top line civic v base model accord civic type winner vw golf v audi golf winner toyota camry xse v lexus e lexus bmw v bmw series nissan altima sr whatever v infiniti bicycle
top trim sure extra make difference imo
beyond many people buy car various reason
would rather drink molten lead either
depends goal wanting reliability good servicability japanese cylinder vehicle day day land rover haha yeah
daily base trim cheaper car would interested select higher end car know still easily fix
vacuum bottom trim expensive car sound deadening ride comfort two highest selection criterion dont get higher trim cheaper car however would never get used land rover
top trim level lower wouldnt buy land rover
top trim unless exotic
definitely base trim expensive one choosing top trim corolla audi exactly choice made year ago dont regret even drop even tho reliability isnt great id still choose range rover scenario ford also reliable possibly one boring car ever
top trim cheaper car wouldnt want land rover would drive bonkers driving porsche macan v gts id take flex limited tt make sure get extended warranty internal waterpump fails mile cheap job
well put way fully loaded top trim kia base model bmw id take kia everytime
reliability quality material quality material bottom trim luxury car almost always nicer material top trim nonluxury make usually even close
much like high spec car id pick based car rather spec case id take range rover
flex matter trim level nothing range rover anyways base model bmw several year enjoyed lot id rather take nicer car less gimics
wouldnt touch either ill rephrase id prefer base camry loaded corolla
ill take want top trim car base option would love civic leather option stick manual seat
id rather ford flex interesting range rover isnt range rover range rover
anything land rover
sorry op almost everybody answered question completely bypassed asking talk shitty land rover answer question though personally would spend money getting higher car fully loaded lower model car
bought top trim civic hatch acura integra regret dont buy land rover
everyone saying wouldnt buy land rover deliberately missing point yes would prefer low trim luxury car high trim budget car high trim mean leather seat glass roof self driving plastic cheapness still remains outside likely powerful engine low trim luxury car mean youre getting leather glass roof minimalless plastic default seat headliner door sill center console get vastly color option beyond blackgray interior higher quality finish build tldr interior supra never interior cclass coupe powerful sure
want stock air conditioning would nice cloth bench seat absolute must
base trim expensive car exception land roveravoid terrible reliability

hey turbo engine crv read turbos need warmed minute prior driving however idling minute long drive turning valid
letting turbo cool shutting engine good prevent oil sitting super hot turbo cooking however normal driving wont make turbo hot itll cook oil startup shutoff normal driving condition normal car special operation required remember manufacturer spend hundred million rd virtually driving condition honda tested engineered
sure start drive drive moderately operating temperature reached thrash need know oil change interval likely fall severe duty maintenance check level regularly
start car wait drop normal operating state smooth running higher usual idle rpm start driving ready avoid revving lugging generally rough input engine operating temperature need floor floor operating temperature drive see fit stop destination give least couple moment shutting let engine get stable state undo seatbelt gather thing etc drove hard shortly stopping give least note far know better modern engine drive warm instead sitting waiting driving get engine temperature much quickly sitting idling would run lot longer outside ideal condition really turbo specific thing end hard driving rest applicable modern personal vehicle engine
owner manual recommend wrx tell drive car easy get operational temp however let warm little driving
youre seriously worried detrimental effect cold engine warm even starting fine likely oil fine degree good like oil good like
owner manual everything need know operating vehicle read manual
need warm car ten minute terrible engine start drive keeping rpm warm
anymore let warm build oil pressure maybe minute temp drive gently oil temp gauge start moving modern turbo engine still cycle fluid turbo even vehicle used civic motor never warmed cabin fully driven bit
idling shutoff really thing turbos arent water cooled thing past basically also checked turbo water cooled nothing worry
year ago turbos first hit market oil cooled back letting cool bit turning engine made sense particularly driving hard prior shut said owner manual today every turbo water cooling dont get hot used also turbos last lot longer used longer concern hence manual longer mention treat like car
unless long drive nurburing youre fine shut
thats boost weather boy
modern engine running synthetic oil dont need warm driving relic many year ago modern turbo engine also need cool turbo liquid cooled oil cooled like old day
long run good oil ok prefer valvoline synthetic use like change often
strategy dont hurt except fuel consumed

one local driving school still manual car give lesson onpossibly option
know someone manual
buy cheap manual beater need function enough drive legal car get moving flat ground clutch without using gas pedal easiest way practice first get car moving slowly releasing clutch feel comfortable start incorporating gas pedal get going quicker
mechanical sympathy buy whatever car want literally learned car mile odometer long youre banging gear like idiot worst damage clutch
rent manual car rental company automatic day might able find manual smaller rental place turo

battery dy driving battery weak jump start needed
take independent shop diagnosing dealer doesnt always best tech
sound like new alternator shit
im agreement independent shop taking peek quickly tell health current alternator battery short descriprion sound like parasitic draw pretty easy competent shop diagnose diagnosis would money well spent instead aggravation causing seen simple harness problem cause youre familiar type troubleshooting good knowledgeable shop best bet could simply intermittent connection good shop guide check battery post cablescheck belt especially alternator connection
badloose connection somewhere bad internal voltage regulator would voltage drop test cable connection going hard truly diagnose info given u battery voltage dy car go completely dead dealership replaced tried different alternator
volt battery car running
guess parasitic draw somewhere vehicle usually random mention happens car
car alternator alternator harness issue gotten multiple bad alternator row dealer one three diode alternator usually fails check fuse also seen radio trunk release switch cause battery drain thing run people stupid trying fix charging battery drain issue usually intermittent see santa fe lot near year range
maybe new alternator broken serpentine belt loose spinning alternator
year model car car known issue contribute problem example new beetle problem cable alternator battery failing replace battery alternator cable
im issue wont hold charge new battery tried putting new alternator still wont hold charge someone said could compression board forgot exact name oem maybe said like brain car telling alternator charge battery part isnt expensive change software shop need reset system costly hear start battery doesnt stay charged long light come battery start im afraid drive anywhere fear getting stalled needing tow someone said go shop say need new battery alternator etc etc charge money instead tell main compression board
take alternator battery autozone bench test could cable problem alternator battery vws problematic odd way
modern charging system controlled engine management system aka computer part guy diagnostic expert chance figuring dealer stumped find different dealer cause dont clue hour complete check ecu see capable controlling alternator
someone need voltage drop testing top head id say wire generator output back battery disconnected high resistance reason
similar problem changed battery changed alternator come find bolt hole new battery negative terminal wasnt deep original didnt realize tight wasnt clamping cable end always start kiss methodology keep simple stupid working space ship

people might keep driving issue really depends far bearing worn condition youre driving bearing failure usually happens three stage overheating vibration noise looseness get bad enough could lead complete breakdown super dangerous especially higher speed youre driving around town risk might feel urgent still gamble bearing could fail time cause damage repair could end costing lot time money best avoid high speed stay road speed limit mph drive carefully keep driving watch bump since make thing worse pay attention whether noise get louder steering start feel there vibration driving notice getting worse best stop driving get fixed immediately getting fixed soon possible safest option need part selection wheel bearing might work check websitehttpbearingsdirectcom safety isnt something gamble know plenty people drive worse issue doesnt mean good idea car wouldnt wait longer necessary
former certified auto mechanic yes definitely need get checked fixed eventually fail cant predict probably next week seen people drive bad bearing month dont cajones big brassy
probably fine could drive regularly next week without issue especially since noise small started get addressed safe might well replace opposite wheel bearing time
likely itll fine wont catastrophically fail next week anything also yeah nobody predict future sometimes seems like half mechanic fielding question like everyone wanting u psychic andor tell want hear realistically probably fine also know
even asking wheel bearing asking stranger could go wrong wheel could fall know

looking general consensus boosting vehicle leave donor vehicle engine connecting jumper cable turn start cable connected
ill long jump car battery still providing power connect prefer connect dead car first also help jumper cable unplug middle plug together side connected side note never heard called boosting thought talking stealing putting turbo supercharger car
jumping always donor car running
donor car connection deeply discharged battery drag charged one starting engine first ensures donor battery ish volt stay matter drained battery
thought boosting vehicle slang stealing
happy opinion corrected expert electricity car taught long ago either way usually fine however donor car weak battery battery cant provide necessary amp start dead car extra draw come alternator draw much could damage alternator donor car therefore taught start donor car connect po po neg ground neg grounded preferably unpainted bolt something farther away battery case spark let donor car charge dead battery minute pleasant conversation turn donir car start dead car disconnect reverse sequence start donor car never caused problem ive also never heard anyone destroying alternator way
important part boosting vehicle lookout dont get caught cop serious note yes leave donor car
search term little remove boost vehicle instead search jumpstart vehicle yes doner vehicle running adding jump cable
leave running constant flow current alternator turn lessens dead vehicle drag donor vehicle battery also avoids starter motor drawing donor vehicle battery ive hearing called boosting ever since kid
never engine running donor car booster pack dont engine necessary run donor car engine donor car battery fine seen damage alternator generator required supply cranking current dead car ignition key switch prevents damaging spike harming electronics donor car
wont say ive jump started vehicle ive done share always kept donor vehicle running careful keep hand cable clear wait minute start recipient car disconnect
boosting vehicle mean committed grand theft auto go jail think mean jumping automobile jumper cable
instruction usually tag owner manualif youre worried follow vehicle specific instruction due sensitive electronics follow instruction ordinarily hook terminal directly cut resistive loss keep good vehicle running high idle prior cranking dead vehicle may hold couple thousand rpm minute battery dead time best method hook charger charge overnight jump subsequent normal use may may get charged enough charging overnightsmart charger ensures back fully charged
pop hood connect cable dead car first donor leave donor car running need max power alternator let sit second longer battery really dead start target vehicle pull cable fast ground first shut hood get drive like soon
regardless ground car negative side first applying positive article saying connected positive first creates chance floating ground damage sensitive circuitry modern car
proper way would start donor vehicle cable hooked lessens voltage differential voltage spike
get jumper box already
latter safety standpoint dont want deal moving part connecting cable
trouble starting jeep patriot everstart jumpstarter didnt trick jnc tow truck operator also towed parked safe location tested battery powering car albeit strongly dim light etc know battery wasnt dead last night electronics car activatedbut morning went clean battery terminal positive terminal lot corrosion power whatsoever radio dim light nothing idea battery powering car electronics suddenly completely dead cleaning terminal wrong lol

standard practice collision repair body shop dusty entire car inside usually end covered dust shop free insurance company paid somehow even shown separate line estimate
yes good company detail every vehicle least make look like came go far beyond especially significant damage insurance company dont typically pay type work directly pay covering car thing reduce dirty vehicle end however theft recovery significant allotted detailing vehicle
yea id wary someone painting body work delivering car dirty hard inspect paint body work
yes standard practice bodyshop ensure paint match well get rid minor imperfection customer happy
even mechanical shop promotion paid detailing atvaclater date
usually normal body shop environment repair usually dusty normal clean car fully since dust get everywhere isnt usually extra charge considered part service

would wait mile personally would drain fill around mile would complete flush sure revenue generator also beneficial life transmission
probably would drain fill every thats honda recommends
waiting mile ridiculous shop wont want touch fluid get old much want flush fluid im sure simple drainrefill service would fine well sure shop us prescribed oem tranny fluid service shop using dont let jiffy lube quick lube joint touch car
agreed follow ford recommendation
doubt refer whoever give warranty cant imagine shop giving warranty ford say
never flushed trans suggests similar interval
fuel treatment really important people family saying waste money google search doesnt really answer question theyre super important difference super cheap one expensive one tia
ill toss bottle every couple year case got water somewhere modern refining storage process pretty sold letting water wasnt always
aaa ran study top tier gas worth read httpswwwaceaaacomautomotiveadvocacytoptiergasolinehtml
largely waste money use namebrand big gas gasoline since detergent additive mixed fuel buy shitty convenience store gasoline youll occasionally need bottle additive maintain clear fuel injector spray pattern injector interrupted fuel deposit fuel economy performance start suffer fuel system problem may require advanced treatment injector replacement
add bottle fuel injection cleaner tank every oil change additive snake oil
need top tier gas google
back u federal trade commission actually worked public good sued manufacturer couple brand treatment product nonproprietary mixture common solvent couldnt prove anything remove claim specific horsepower fuel economy increase making may apply brand youve ever seen harsh solvent gasoline hard believe anything theyre willing make specific claim method cleaning fuel system one thing proven work feeding naphthabased cleaner like seafoam directly engine via intake manifold diluted fuel auto manufacturer produced version product calling top end cleaner combustion chamber cleaner clean carbon deposit valve cylinder head piston however riskfree dropin thing dump much damage catalytic converter stall engine make horrific cloud smoke
there enough detergent gas major station dont really need anymore youre getting cheapo gas name station middle nowhere regularly maybe youd exception
others said think top tier gas pretty much job know honda officially recommends annual techron cleaner tank something heck bona fide product around long time
fuel come location regionally top tier fuel better detergentsadditives mixed fwiw certification requires payment labeled top tier fuel
subaru seems recommend one pea
ive yet see proof benefit
dont need one unless actually issue really diesel user freezing weather may use something bc fuel gells gas nope stick top tier quality fuel like shell
put redline fuel system cleaner gas tank near empty filled tank drove mile feel like brand new car stuff work restored lost power improved fuel economy make engine run quieter
worth money keeping injector fuel system clean definitely useful diesel city driving rather long journey clog less
depends vehicle

drive dead sensor take mechanic get done get around itll get worse gas mileage maybe run rough wont keep car driving car year old probably going hard put new one even thread chaser might end taking mechanic paying screw sensor
standalone afr gauge asking doesnt go lean fine super handy wire output stock ecu work pinch
sensor completely disconnected car default premade fuel map emphasis since doubt itll happen sensor isnt fully disconnected ie car still getting fucked signal cause issue since sensor try adjust fuel trim nonexistent problem since car doesnt know sensor broken make sure sensor isnt communicating car
make sure heater circuit wire usually white receives volt doesnt bleed referencessignal wire

untrained part replacer mechanic one simple basic diagnostic procedure trade
total random guess bad earth connection around starter someone else mentioned relay
dont know tested thing instead shotgunning part youd know whats wrong
remember correctly also starter relay relay could sticky first starter taking dump associated wiring relay
tech went older escape rd starter went oem yeah stupid expensive worked starter alternator ac compressor always buy oem customer doesnt want go route dont offer warranty pay labor time
jumping work starter working look alternator regulator might get lucky dirty cable
cam position sensor
bad replacement part happen lot aftermarket part new remanufactured starter dealer may trick luck stay bad
little gear spinning going tell bad starter doesnt go back cant engage ring gear spin engine start
think actually metal plate connects fuse box power shitty battery cowling plate bolt loosen sometimes create start normally followed code bcm
explanation sound mostly plausable keep going back said replaced battery know registered battery car everything car start battery efficiency drop little bit thus needing alternate increase recharge battery maintain status quo long period time turn substantial amount juice starter got replaced alternate still producing extra charge get trickled thru starting system playing havoc starter solenoid cant stress important register new battery car ecuecm im saying im right worth checking good luck
starter even make noise trying start youre issue similar story car turn related gearshift knowing safe position shift gear back start start daughter leaving interior light trunk completely closed drain battery requires jump start fix already suspect battery destroyed discharge ultimately would get stuck somewhere unable start car clicking sound anything suspected starter starter solenoid hitting wrench seem help maybe coincidence recently discovered dont actually need hit wrench shift gear bit itll start car import mile exactly scenario might applicable
start parent bought pontiac vibe use get work recently changed oil oil filter used handbreak keep place ever since whenever try get move revves feel like something keeping stuck place push back whenever reverse refuse move forward without heavy revving im savvy car know basic anyone who experienced similar issue know whats wrong fix

toyota leave exterior running light open driver door pull key never open driver door could leaving exterior light draining battery
happens try removing key open door get lock door unlock door get back restart several vehicle would go battery saving mode shut engine leave key ignition open door problem always solved combination removing key opening closing door trying restart
turn key light dash anything may poor connection one battery terminal next time happens leave key pop hood give battery terminal gentle tap something see come life
would also check battery terminal theyre corroded make starting car really weird time connection
hit unlock key fob use key driver door smart key system disabled transmitter left range car minute
second time started minute anything sat car waited open door move around others suggested opening door closing made car start may security feature nothing eventually started think maybe starter
dont idle camry
sound like starter going happens try tapping hammer baseball bat
would start charging system tested alternator battery may draining battery starting getting enough charge driving yard
immobilizer active sequence look door open key infoot brake keyless start command deviation car assumes somone broke steal spoofing key programmed logic programmer never assumed anyone would sleep car
sound remarkably similar issue mazda fuel rail issue idea might car argue three dealership wasnt battery one finally believed

also jumpstarting car letting engine run usually enough charge dead battery would remain connected charger least couple hour attempting start engine often use car every day happening would agree parasitic drain battery car get used couple time week short trip example battery discharge time best solution latter case battery maintainer keep battery full parked access electrical outlet sure check interior light make sure shutting walking away car probably common cause sudden dead battery another thing keep mind longer battery stay dead chance going bad increase meaning wont hold charge like lead plate inside battery become sulphated

hello fellow poster chevy hhr mile symptom battery vehicle charge volt regardless long vehicle driven battery warranty replaced matter good practice part store replaced charge without testing original symptom remained new battery charged externally charger negative terminal removed take full hold charge volt feel confident alternator regulator defective question battery circuit motor idling using volt meter good ground positive lead voltage would would expect read im guessing something north volt voltage low say volt alternator regulator defective repair regulator alternator need replaced
battery read charged unless reading surface charge immediately disconnecting charging source wait minute test battery youve disconnected float charger good battery test ok battery test remove battery circuit cause voltage spike damage sensitive electronics battery circuit read engine running sometimes alternator problem intermittent make sure cable alternator battery tight free corrosion
vehicle running alternator charging battery voltage read vehicle battery fully charged read least battery voltage isnt vehicle running alternator probably longer charging
far replacing voltage regulator design incorporate alternator however trend newer model include regulator pcm ecm latter replacement computer likely need programing important properly identify setup vehicle replacement
dont jump alternator bad yet wouldnt old disconnect battery car run alternator trick anything newer cause damage vehicle hhr shouldnt additional voltage regulator battery ground like car alternator doesnt seem like belt ac related issue case either unless condition havent looked could failed ground battery connected multi meter setting one probe battery ground alternator also check engine block read volt number represents voltage loss value volt subtract volt goal leave closer case fixing bad ground replacing failed ground cable isnt possible run another cable battery negative block good ground chassis firewall
alternator charge volt also modern charging system controlled pcmecm actually turn alternator completely battery charged electrical demand low important know charging system work diagnosing another thing people look checking diode ripple load high load might charging fine low load one high load doesnt charge also check loose corroded connection voltage drop test easy multimeter

theory friction material transmission longer supposed rather fluid remove fluid friction material replace nice new slippery fluid transmission may slip rendering useless
toyota world havent done every mile would recommend never however owner want done obviously there always chance itll never move power shop came corvette ton mile said thing however owner insisted replaced everything sure enough zero forward gear
advice change fluid come past experience transmission neglected point starting display symptom owner decided try change fluid upon service inevitable happens transmission fails shop technician blamed happening vehicle owner wanted repaired free many case ultimately happens shop get ripped tried usually still get badmouthed even take huge loss repair
slip change broken transmission begin
clunk slipping catching gear burned old fluid contaminates cause wear lead slipping change regularly keep dont change dont slipping old fuid contaminates friction clean fluid old fluid could reason still working clunking grabbing may delay rebuild replacement v change assuming already going bad
suck telling someone yea car drove fine fucked going cost
seems hit miss early mercury something like mile overdue fluid old fluid came looking like mud decided change transition rd th bit rough new fluid filter didnt seem change much anything still delay followed mild jerk rd th mph several year later slip transition st nd change fluid filter thing put bottle lucas stop slip still keep going going mile fluid stay clean welp gonna keep rolling lol
regular change good havent regularly changed fluid exacerbate problem even doesnt likely wont fix anything
old people dont understand correlation equal causation transmission fluid change start acting little bit changed fluid fail shortly obviously fluid change caused
saying isnt mechanic ase automatic transmission curriculum took last year hear story going way definitely following ase defer consensus
friend bought vw propaganda shouldnt andor cant change atf jetta tdi decided change fluid filter downshift becoming problematic changing fluid filter shifting problem became manageable sold car helped new owner service transmission two year ago car still running original transmission
havent servicing transmission regular interval dont change fluid new fluid fresh detergent may harm good end washing material friction plate sound like time new transmission sorry bearer bad news
majority time get changed either use wrong fluid andor put much little wouldnt think hard apparently also doesnt help bazillion different fluid spec v year ago
slipping tranny jeep took old put thickening stuff solve problem cant go second still drive fine taking easy shift repressing gas
suck drain fluid add lucas transmission additive worked great year gm transmission
fresh detergent new fluid make debris come loose plug orfices damage internal component
clunk something simple enginetransmission mount odds inside transmission wouldnt shifting properly mostly myth change fluid break transmission transmission already failing already changed fluid regardless car id change really cant make worse actually failing good chance fine though either need relearn fluid service
pressurized flush drain refill flush high mileage cause issue drain fill removing material would ended filter anyway
changing every mile probably would predicament lucas transmission witchcraft stuff pray start saving transmission
toyota master tech explains video around min httpsyoutubetevkuvkxthttpsyoutubetevkuvkxt
change trans fluid maintenance start acting shifting funny youre better leaving till doesnt work anymore especially car get changed stop working week dont care toyota engine might last million mile whatever transmission lifespan like well taken care car longer bunch easy highway driving
vehicle would drop pan replace filter replace amount came would fluid flush flushing system machine mess transmission
honda accord drain fill trans fluid week later transmission hasnt done history unknown say leave alone
toyota lifetime fluid like gm say sealed unit change anyway car plus mile never fluid changed thats reason theyre telling change run risk losing clutch material fine
acurahonda recommend method
friction material also flow bearing gear causing additional wear causing wear prematurely changing fluid cause slippage transmission already need replacement
mechanic dont say dealership push onto tech lifetime fluid something go youll buy new car parent audi fan take care car turned several time requesting fluid change even denied tire rotation ive literally told sir audi require tire rotation quattro awd tech sad effort theyll put profit sorry rant find indy mechanic
well im gonna say yes admit neglected car point almost pontiac gt never changed transmission fluid filter car seems running fine ive thought changing im debating problem hate enclosed system dont transmission dipstick make hard yes could gone mechanic put lift changed way charge way much car level ground level check fluid plug
theyre old believe fairy tale crud holding transmission together
short answer misinformed believe myth unfortunately perpetuated industry due people incorrectly performing fluid filter maintenance uninterested learning truth incapable admitting theyve wrong long
transmission old thing keeping working sludgy transmission fluid clutch metal shaving like friction modifier keep transmission slipping remove thing start slip consensus maintain regularly maintain
wait change trans fluid till problem youre gonna problem
well quite frankly fluid probably holding transmission together nice old replace youre bound probably issue guess could remove fluid clean pan something replace transmission filter refill trans old fluid sure say world standard transmission fluid doesnt need changed
wait youre th camry since
changing fluid getting flushed kill think transmission one way pump flush fluid get pushed wrong way blow inner seal dumping fluid removing pan replacing said fluid fine done regularly reference auto manually
fluid burnt changing actually make transmission slip shifting due increased lubricity
least back friction material would deteriorate acidity new fluid leading myth old fluid full stuff held transmission together actually new fluid would destroy myth pervasive day friction material changed susceptible change ph manufacturer even say okay change fluid mile fluid dont know effect new fluid day
nothing wrong changing fluid transmission oil burnt civic bought second hand changed fluid problem till date one buddy driving altima km mile felt transmission slip advised change fluid hasnt problem since nissan known transmission issue
im year old purchased new mercury broahm transmission went mile mile warranty repaired atv mile went swore would never buy american made vehicle since driven toyota many mile never changed transmission fluid flushed transmission never transmission issue
come dont change fluid there problem suspect problem may end transmission performs better worse change change proper interval last really long time wait there problem there chance fail soon change imo better fail predictably rather randomly
manufacturer state lifetime fluid service interval
start fluid change make worse mean need new transmission anyway unless youre pushing old fluid torque converter need drain fill multiple time driving dozen mile drain change filter transmission need proper hydraulic pressure work could easily solenoid weak mount well
theyre afraid getting blamed transmission fails change fluid filter ive changed fluid filter every single car ive daily driven never hurt includes car mile likely original fluid filter ive done transmission already slipping still helped shift better customer blame mechanic stupidest thing theyre going risk lawsuit make change fluid filter youll better
havent seen mentioned yet also debris settle transmission passage debris settled somewhere hasnt caused failure adding new fluid could pick deposit move cause failure
ive always followed rule working ok replace fluid dont wait till started acting funny start maintaining
several origin mostly myth way back automatic transmission used use sperm whale oil handy dandy thing called endangered specie act came stop using sperm oil instead made synthetic werent good synthetic better transmission full sweet delicious whale oil replaced lousy synthetic garbage could fail shortly fact automatic transmission failure increased fold year immediately passage endangered specie act reason stuck around transmission start slipping people try change fluid fix late transmission fails anyway people blame fluid change fail regardless flushing transmission dislodge deposit end clogging passage somewhere transmission creating issue personally recommend drain fill rather flush even doesnt replace fluid refill transmission wrong level wrong fluid create issue
bought tacoma year ago changed everything transmission rear differential steering brake fluid clunk starting stopping fluid change clunk completely went away shifted smoother truck still running kid truck good luck
youre risking knocking loose built sludge friction material would come fluid change atf lot detergent new fresh detergent get clean sludge wash place dont want sludge course changed fluid regular oldwivestale question apply want risk could flush absolute living crap theory fine sister honda probably saved transmission people lucky also probably super expensive mechanic instead older brother feeling pretty ballsy
change fluid bump gear normally mean one solenoid sticky may solve issue see easy swap
change yes flush
ive never heard tech transmission shop say change transmission fluid lot even say dont flush transmission sure flush cooler transmission additive fluid degrade get consumed depleted fluid loses beneficial property thats reason fluid change reason flushing sealing done transmission unfortunately come gunk get deposited valve body channel losing extra sealing worn transmission component lead poor pressure causing poor shifting slippage
need deep swallow
change starting low mileage okay never changed dont start
transmission fluid longer life span cvts want scientific answer
lab tell service exactly condition fluid guessing excessive maintenance oil change needed like blood test medicine preventive care
year wrenching happened twice ford chevy truck fluid brown smell kind burnt leave alone shop sure inform customer consequence changed
look toyota service manual tell change transmission fluid unfortunately likely gone far long dirty oxidized plain worn fluid started grenade transmission fluid change may cause total failure point dislodge sludge clutch material small crevice valve body make pas area supposed causing shift issue noise coming transmission replace point source im master toyota tech
also depends frequently change happened one missed couple change new fluid could cause harm good day plan replacing transmission thats company say life time oil subaru forester changed trans fluid cause lot city driving top roading
nothing manual old never life changed trans fluid topped even extremely rare
many transmission fluid change vehicle never transmission crap knock wood
rtfm
misshifting single dump fill replace fluid replenish friction modifier fluid degrade time exposure moisture lifetime fluid lie majority time sort misshift doesnt wont harm improves shifting completely another dump fill transmission clutch wear eventually wear fail maintaining fluid wear faster flush old transmission stir friction material sludge pan run valve body causing badthingstm happen
drain fill usually fine flush knock shit loose get stuck dont want havent keeping maintenance
year ago transmission builder trading work said showed recommended never changing fluid first thing almost car oil soap detergent compound atf soap detergent surface wear cleaning buildup happen atf disappears little added almost status quo happens little bit added doesnt change anything whole new amount atf added cleaning action full strength soapdetergent remove good buildup causing instant wear failure showed part truly worn failure automatic transmission many grimy almost new measurement wear part showed worn beyond reason part coming transmission less milage shinny clean worn completely less milage worn completely transmission atf changed grimy part worn higher milage transmission topped needed builder recommended never changing atf shop owner oversold full atf change
mile transmission truck bought never fluid change ever decided part overhaul drain flush refill trans fluid came looked like heavily burned oil transmission immediately upon first time putting gear slammed slipped failed shift etc two fluid change majority fluid torque converter doesnt come standard drain fill changed trans filter time finally got trans fluid red maybe total fluid change truck doesnt like shift nd gear replaced shift solenoid refill finally act normal moral story yes friction material fluid help draining cause issue depositing gunk throughout path downwards clog solenoid etc possible recover time faint hearted might good idea
watched youtube video recommend looking
friend worked automotive manufacturing industry say factory transmission fluid better counter fluid buy always recommended going dealer heater filter machine service original fluid transmission last lasted year transmission issue ownership procedure done life truck know people argue truck well mile never touched transmission except way
would want know first tif changed ever ago every whatever swap heavily used transmission fluid grit new stuff slickno grit actually make transmission shift worse able happen pretty easy diy though sell additive put grit transmission fluid help prevent loss shifting youtube video got several car maintenance repair work saving ton hope help
here believe year driving experience several transmission issue running new low mileage vehicle change fluid early often like every go mile without tranny service pan leak drain half fluid top new repeat every get beyond service dont bother anything gonna shock system top fluid needed run til there issue
repeat heard told without personal evidence evidence ase master tech since serviced vehicle shop toyota specialist never single trans failure could linked fluid change one would perform fluid service make risk transmission failure could fault anyone understands inner working transmission know fluid vital lubrication operation clutch brake valve fluid break becomes contaminated increase wear advising someone leave wrong rare occasion story come happened myfill blank ignores thousand fluid change flush go fine keep car road
thunk eaither mount valve body need replacing
simple dont full flush keep diluted partially old fluid measure come add much back slippery fluid cause slip old worn simply keep fluid fresher itll run cooler last longer neglect grenade
read manual
change expect detergent new fluid break loose build clog solenoid problem get worse bring back shop fix mint people never second step assume broken
often difficult however data show transmission performance shifting durability massively improved regular oil change
think holdover myth say go owner manual fluid changed regal g socalled sealed system need special machine im mile fluid change shouldnt number year
ive always heard old dont change might cause slip within regular maintenance keep fresh
corolla mile got transmission fluid never changed single issue slipping catching let ride
time either new transmission transmission rebuild reason dont change transmission fluid nothing move place break goto use several dozen disk material transmission worn center shift cause issue car mile transmission mile replacing blow ever happens first
well here experience camry friend camry friend something ford van lexus northeast car year plus original transmission fluid city highway driving experiencing major rust point care transmission car original fluid mechanic plus year say leave alone dealership maintenance book think changing doesnt guarantee longer life waste money especially day real careful certain temperature like changing oil wouldnt trust anybody job youre always running chance something going wrong rav day im changing fluid speed expect least im already surprised many people never change transmission fluid go year many people end problem whatever stay away lucas stuff
want change go ahead youre taking small gamble want leave alone likely go without transmission issue
one high mile likely never changed fluid change avoided
myth isnt true bmw transmission fucked couldnt break mph would shift slam every gear sometimes slip gear mechanic told best bet transmission rebuild simple fluid change mile later year still running perfect shift smooth slippage problem whatsoever month symptom persisted slowly went away another fluid change even bucking st nd went away another month later silverado never trans fluid change ever thing mechanic told needed new trans torque converter started slipping well fluid change ran right rain still mile later lmao even corolla mile got symptom transmission problem changed trans fluid symptom gone torque converter stopped slipping transmission quieted change smoothed shifting slowly happened week first change wasnt instant gunk need slowly dissolved myth perpetuated oldheads trying way hard think intuitively mechanic see damage transmission tend flush fluid change myth fluid change damage worn transmission came flush bad part free gunk put new place sometimes take part already close last leg cause totally new problem youre supposed change fluid little often gunk like engine gunked want slowly dissolve instead dislodging add trans fluid change transmission still running good youre high mileage incur problem issue folk come first fluid change well experience symptom bad trans fluid replace fluid sometimes problem dont randomly go away depending issue trans perfect condition replace fluid going cause issue issue already present
transmission already hurting make worse specifically already slipping every mile depending type transmission good practice
following recommendation manufacturer service
older car went shop transmission oil changed going forward reverse loud bang reverse plate shattered
people saying change fluid oil probably armchair mechanic fault mention torque converter clutch sticking deapply due hydraulics fluid allowing slip properly add fm like lubegard shudder fixx fix need replace fluid fm addition confirmation test fluid spent remember lifetime fluid lifetime term used lawyer ask meaning come life equipment independent similar unit meaning clunk lifetime clunk thats lifetime
thought heavy equipment tech youre preventative measure known issue youre probably good change changing fluid already problem usually exasperate issue automotive world usually best save flush money payment new transmission point
ram say replace tow lot fluid still look pink nice fluid filter replacement todo list month
im fine drain fill old transmission never serviced flush ive issue old unmaintained transmission trans flush machine
theory seems transmission already less destroyed still operating continue operating longer fluid isnt changed may true still going start problem soon either way fine fluid changed ruined everything also probably ton people dont anything late trans acting get fluid changed blame causing failure resulted getting fluid changed month ago think case like putting bandaid someone stage cancer blaming bandaid die
transmission tech reason wont simple fluid service high mileage vehicle especially one service history issue get worse service liable
real reason ultimately liability
bought nissan xterra auction sitting coyote year every would shift fucked make horrible noise got fluid changed shift like butter mile btw
goshthis dillema question getting popular debate chicken egg
new vehicle cant even fluid changed designed go kk shut
changed fluid regular basis every mile go ahead first time risk causing failure automatic transmission operate hydraulicly fluid serf many function lubrication cooling hydraulic operation transmission many servo apply piston various clutch operating transmission fluid pressure fluid collect friction material clutch wear friction material wear rubber teflon seal allow transmission operate change fluid regularly kept minimum wear get worse friction material start fill gap wear created flush material seal start leak cause slippage slippage cause excessive wear heat lead failure inevitable walk home mode hope help generally transmission regularly serviced flush otherwise vehicle pan replaceable filter replace filter whatever fluid come change approximately leave itnon serviceable filter
simple google save hassel reading junk troll legit answer
drain fluid change filter usually work well ill never go another transmission flush though old girl slipped like mad put lucas helped little
back day transmission doesnt drain plug pan gasket pain leak common
transmission need maintenance like anything else vehicle difference people see sealed unit unlike engine transmission fluid pick metal like engine oil changing stop getting place cause problem
owned subaru outback cylinder cvt manufacturer maintenance schedule cvt fluid lifetime owner swore asking trouble didnt faithfully change every thirty thousand mile heard story dealer stated recommend changing fluid asked owner like never changed per manufacturer recommendation opinion vary sure fwiw never issue mile traded
kind flush bad transmission id probably spill fill new filter reluctant could always siphon quart add back fresh fluid kind step right direction
always refer owner manual first
old wife tale shop dont want touch transmission way overdue likelihood failure much higher unmaintained unit due new fluid due fact owner requesting theyre problem due poor maintenance ive corrected problem transmission flush filter going fix burned unit friction material fluid block filter giving extra grip worn clutch
one problem people usually want replaced something wrong instead replacing preventative maintenance done regularly prevent issue longterm
dump fill filter change manual unless fairytale lifetime service mumbo jumbo mile cvts apparently lower interval flushing dont worry whats torque converter basic thing
transmission fluid gear oil massive amount detergent dispersments mean fluid disollves gunk tranmission addatives keep junk stasis cause harm automatic transmission there ton tiny passage easily clogged transmission fluid cannot solve metalso something get stuck there good chance destroys entire transmission said ive never seen simple drain full flush cause problem doesnt mean issue already drain fill cause many case fixed problem
theyre complete idiot there legitimate reason change fluid old

hey everyone lexus e dont drive muchmostly short trip parked garage time last oil change done dealer june mile used synthetic oil likely mobil something similar today april im mile ive driven mile since last oil change dealer sticker say change oil mile im nowhere near however almost year since last change know usual advice change synthetic oil every mile month im curious think car thats barely driven always garaged go ahead change oil time safe wait hit mileage anyone else gone longer year synthetic oil low mile real risk dealermanufacturers upsell would love hear experience thought thanks
change mine yearly even dont hit mileage also good time check fluid filter wiper blade etc
would change year short trip good oil
would change typically every mile matter recommended year something isnt driven often youre looking year max dont risk engine something minor
change year never hit mile
smell dipstick smell petrol blowby cold running short trip change oil immediately diluted gasoline dribbling piston ring
op fwiw drive vehicle mile annually always renew oil every month question asked
kind mileage change yearly wife drive avalon engine model short distance every day change oil every six month mile whichever come first rarely mile
definitely change oil oil break time especially really chemically altered synthetic oil like heard either way oil lot additive break even separate especially driven regularly also oxidize get moisture thus lubricating system properly best follow rule change oil specified mileskilometers month depending oil
always annually never hit mileage
thousand mile year truck change every year trip long enough fully heat engine drive fuel water oil short trip murder oil since said short trip would changing annually good synthetic every mo conventional oil
short trip severe service see owner manual change oil sooner later
jaguar put mile year change oil every year take hour consider insurance
try change mine twice year end summer end winter full synthetic expensive would probably go yearly mine
oil break time best replace
send sample lab analysis help determine correct service period exact case
wouldnt worry like oil suddenly go bad youll fine make sure level correct however another commenter said good idea check vehicle make sure light work suspension tight sort thing rubber absolutely degrade time span
twice year min regardless milage metric hit
changed annually owned exact car maybe easiest car ever change oil personally would use oil instead im fairly sure thats lexus recommended factory era
change oil rubber degrade oxygen water air cant run away simply staying indoors though thin car unless hybrid
yeah change degrades bit time
one year month whichever come first
change quart oil plus oil filter plus minus quart change oil
type mile change oil beginning every driving season put away hibernation end year probably overkill know oil cheap plan keeping car forever
coil spring thats snapped need drive garage fixed safe everything see google say dont drive im concerned im unsure else get garage without costing absolute fortune

yes
badbut drum brake sentra easy
cheap
ah old drum brake hated fucking thing spring retainer spring special tool help get expensive tool know course need brake cleaner get brake dust clean area used need push slave cylinder might require siphoning brake fluid reservoir hood adding fluid pad wear fair amount dirty work

post scream dont know much think know real issue oil level thats assuming checked right coolant bit filled non issue car arent ice cold tech work bit filled correct leaking drain hole leak better little tire lose air pressure winter thats normal function far drain plug go leaking probably tightened maybe ftlbs car dependant course usually right feel even tighter back leverage
depends winter tire last inflatedpressures adjusted ambient temp like last adjusted ive seen occasion tire pressure adjusted factory spec either becomes colder warmer pressure change drastically summer tire touched sitting whole winter ive adjusted pressure storage always lose psi oil check oil wipe dipstick reinsert check level pull stick inspect crush washer crushed death thing id replace assuming everything else done properly
inflate tire intentionally car ride better way
two good answer addition car level relative park incline direction car tilt oil towards dip stick inevitably show full
old parent pressure neglect overfilling come age see shop time one come body shop say need get fixed kid see
none whats posted issue except oil level bet way exaggerated someone inexperianced trying sound like caught huge mistake someone op trying make something nothing karma point
honestly reason learned car work curious come conclusion engine overfilled drain oil measure came something engine took say quart quart find hard believe would running long youd surely blowing seal massive increase oil pressure regardless tale like always work thing go shop alignment get new tire
would ashamed tech worked car pointless question clearly tech work doesnt care hasnt taught properly oil coolant level added oil coolant sure theyre mixing tire pressure seasonal tire hadnt touched surprised theyre underinflated actual question
way know maintenance item performed properly diy bitter experience discovering truth dealership change oil oil filter trans fluid differential fluid brake fluid coolant didnt even bother clean outside filter hide fraud

extremely expensive compared expensive per kg machine take long recharge vehicle compared older one there usually additional labor charge well thats actually pretty good price compared shop evac recharge
keep mind refrigerant stupid expensive
people already chiming case needed additional validation thats fine price ryf stupid expensive refrigerant addition older style machine cant use shop likely upgraded ac machine also huge cost enjoy cool breeze
ask would cost anything cannot charge whatever want without approval told fix thats actually pretty reasonable yf refrigerant pricey equipment needed pricey slow tedious process pay labor time
used yf thats call cheap like hazard tool requirement thank epa manufacturer
ac recharge also dangerous diy friendly thing also discharging refrigerant atmosphere illegal technically need shop ot
newer refrig price crazy
last time bought lb container yf cost bought theyre usually anywhere depending whether buy middle summer winter demand isisnt high buy lb thats huge price difference time charge slightly longer well expensive system around
pay hot whats issue
probably warranty extension compressor shaft seal condenser honda could leaking repaired recharged free know people think dealer devil would rather pay pocket
know industry refused use co far less dangerous substance refrigerant would cheap like money printing press
need add refrigerant circuit mean leaking sure didnt also repair leak there point adding refrigerant circuit leak repaired also illegal knowingly vent refrigerant atmosphere
remember back gmc acadia rolled needed rear evaporator super common refrigerant labor evaporator separately combined customer warranty like mile something like refrigerant pretty sure service manager helped bit felt bad barely service
